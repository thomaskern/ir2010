 This financial 
 statement is a summary of information in the audited 
 Annual Accounts, the Directors&#146; Report and 
 the Annual Business Statement, all of which will 
 be available to Members and Depositors free of charge 
 on demand at every office of Norwich and Peterborough 
 Building Society from 8 April 2002. The Statement 
 is a consolidation of the results of the Society 
 and its subsidiary undertakings.
 
 
Summary 
 Directors&#146; Report
 
 I am pleased to announce 
 that we have had yet another good year with a satisfactory 
 rise in profits and an increase in total assets 
 of 5.6% to a record £2,459 million. 
 
I 
 feel very privileged to have been appointed Chairman 
 of your Society. As I have become increasingly familiar 
 with the workings of the business, there has been 
 a strong reinforcement of my initial impression 
 of a high quality organisation led by an impressive 
 management team.
 
What 
 has also been confirmed is the important role that 
 a building society like Norwich and Peterborough 
 can play in the local community. As is absolutely 
 right in a mutual organisation the focus is very 
 much on you, the members. This focus is evident 
 from the way our branches are run, through to the 
 strategic decision making that takes place at Board 
 level.
 
I 
 see the strength of your Society coming from three 
 distinct features: familiarity, access and trust.
 
Familiarity 
 with Norwich and Peterborough in the region is exceptionally 
 high and is reinforced by our extensive branch presence, 
 very visible branding and support of regional initiatives 
 ranging from sports clubs to local charities.
 
Because 
 of their continuing contact with members, particularly 
 through the branch network, there is a great understanding 
 amongst all the staff of the Group of customer needs, 
 not just in terms of products and services but more 
 importantly, how you want to be treated. Like many 
 of our competitors, we have been investing in systems 
 and processes to meet our customer needs as they 
 change over time. I firmly believe though that the 
 best customer relationship system for a business 
 like ours is based on a welcoming smile from one 
 of our staff.
 
This 
 familiarity with the Society is not just limited 
 to our branches, however as for an increasing number 
 of you, the most regular contact is by telephone 
 or via the Internet. Our website strongly reflects 
 the Society's brand values and combines ease of 
 use with a wide range of products and services.
 
Ease 
 of access to 
 our products and services is key to the role the 
 Board sees for the Society. As our competitors close 
 branches, particularly in rural locations, we continue 
 to see our branch network as the prime means of 
 meeting the needs of our members. We do recognise 
 though that many members who are regular visitors 
 to our branches will also sometimes want to contact 
 the Society or transact business using other means.
 
This 
 is why we have made accessibility through all available 
 channels an important part of our long-term strategy. 
 Telephone and increasingly Internet access is of 
 growing importance but it would be quite wrong to 
 categorise members by one channel or another. What 
 members want is choice and we aim to provide you 
 with the choice of how you contact us in a way that 
 is most convenient and suitable to you at the time.
 
The 
 final element of trust 
 is often taken for granted in relation to financial 
 institutions, but what this means in practice can 
 vary widely. The Board has a clear view of what 
 trust means at Norwich and Peterborough. Irrespective 
 of the legal position, the directors of the Society 
 regard themselves as trustees of the interests of 
 members. This in itself underlines the value of 
 the Society's mutual status. Combined with the Society's 
 strong financial position, I hope we will continue 
 to enjoy your trust into the future.
 
Since 
 the last Annual Report, there have been a number 
 of changes to the Board. Martin Mays-Smith retired 
 from the Board and as Chairman at the end of the 
 last Annual General Meeting. Having been Chairman 
 for the past 11 years, the current good standing 
 and sound financial position of the Society is powerful 
 evidence of the high quality of Martin's leadership. 
 We all owe him a debt of thanks.
 
Apart 
 from myself, one new member has joined the Board 
 during the past year. Alex Tweedie has very substantial 
 experience of commercial lending in East Anglia 
 and this will be particularly relevant as we expand 
 this activity within the region.
 
Turning 
 now to the future outlook, it is difficult these 
 days to open a newspaper and not find a reference 
 to these being "uncertain times". In reality, 
 the world outlook is no more uncertain than it was 
 one year or 25 years ago. It is just that at the 
 moment, people's fears crystallise out more readily 
 as a result of the shocking images of the events 
 of 11th September 2001 and their aftermath. We live 
 in a risky world but then that has always been the 
 case. That is why mutual institutions like building 
 societies came into being in the first place: to 
 spread risk which would be too great if undertaken 
 on an individual basis. Just as the world will continue 
 to be an uncertain place, so there will be a continuing 
 need for the financial strength and security that 
 a mutual business like Norwich and Peterborough 
 can offer.
 
In 
 the management of the Society, we will continue 
 to build its financial strength whilst making sure 
 that what we offer to you, our members, meets your 
 financial services needs as these change over time. 
 In doing this, we will ensure that the tangible 
 and intangible resources of the Society are used 
 to the members' best long-term advantage. Whilst 
 deposit taking and mortgage lending will remain 
 at the core of our business, the increasing accessibility 
 of the Society's services through branches, telephone 
 and the Internet enables us to offer a growing range 
 of products and services. Whether 
 it is mortgages, savings and investment products, 
 insurance or share dealing services, our aim is 
 to offer you high quality service and value underpinned 
 with the trust that the Norwich and Peterborough 
 brand generates.

Business 
 Highlights 
 
 
- In 
 March 2000, we sent out a survey to every member 
 asking what they wanted most from us. From the 
 results we developed a Members' Agenda to ensure 
 that we work on those things that are most important 
 to our members. The Members' Agenda includes rewarding 
 members for their loyalty, dealing with them in 
 a flexible manner and helping to teach children 
 to save by offering special accounts. Following 
 the Members' Agenda, we introduced a number of 
 new initiatives during the year including a two 
 year Fixed Rate Loyalty Bond for adults and a 
 loyalty mortgage scheme. 
 
 
 
- During 
 the year, through our relationship with Norwich 
 Union, an Equity Release Plan was introduced for 
 those people who wish to release some of the equity 
 in their property whilst they continue to live 
 in their own home. 
 
 
 
- 
 In April, we introduced Norwich Union's Stakeholder 
 Pensions onto our ScreenTalk® branch presentation 
 system to help our members gain a better understanding 
 of this new pension scheme via a structured demonstration 
 with a member of staff.
 
 
 
- Interest 
 rates fell steadily across the year, with seven 
 separate cuts by the Bank of England totalling 
 2%. 
 
 
 
- In 
 December our standard variable mortgage rate for 
 residential mortgages was the lowest that we have 
 offered since 1956.
 
 
 
- We 
 continued to expand our Internet service and members 
 can now apply for mortgages, insurance, savings 
 accounts, share dealing and personal loans online. 
 In October 2001, we extended our Internet service 
 to all our Gold Current account holders and from 
 January 2002 postal accounts were made available 
 online. 
 
 
 
- During 
 the year branches in Sheringham, Leiston and Plumstead 
 Road (Norwich) were refurbished and we moved our 
 branches in March and Ipswich into more central 
 locations, making them more accessible to customers.
 
 
 
- Moneybox 
 replaced the Society's ATMs during 2001 with its 
 own more modern machines. Moneybox now handles 
 all aspects of the ATM service including maintenance 
 and cash replenishment of the machines. 
 
 
 
- We 
 are also working hard to develop better information 
 about the needs of each of our members. We have 
 introduced a Customer Relationship Management 
 strategy which is helping us to integrate the 
 information that we hold about our members and 
 allowing us to communicate personally with them 
 as individuals, face to face, over the phone, 
 via the Internet or by post.
 
 
 
- In 
 November 2001 the Building Societies Ombudsman 
 found against the Society on the matter of TESSA 
 and ISA interest rates. A member had complained 
 that the Society had paid a higher rate of interest 
 on its Mini Cash ISA than on one of its TESSAs 
 between April 1999 and September 2000 when the 
 TESSA rates were raised to equalise them with 
 the ISA rates. The Ombudsman decided in favour 
 of the member and recommended that the Society 
 should pay him compensation. We regard the Ombudman's 
 decision as wrong and unfair and we are therefore 
 seeking a judicial review of it in the High Court. 
 We strongly feel that we have treated our TESSA 
 investors fairly. ISAs are different from and 
 did not replace TESSAs. We consistently paid our 
 members amongst the top rates of the major bank 
 and building society providers of TESSAs and ISAs 
 and in no way could we be accused of downgrading 
 our TESSAs across this period. As a mutual society, 
 we wish to ensure that the interests of all members 
 are properly considered. If the Court agrees with 
 the Ombudsman, however, we will pay compensation 
 to all our members with qualifying TESSA accounts 
 at an estimated cost of £1.3 million.
 
 
 
- In 
 2001, we donated £177,000 in cash and kind 
 to a range of charities and community organisations 
 that support the homeless, lone-parent groups, 
 places of worship and large and small community 
 groups throughout the region. An increasing proportion 
 of this results from individual members' suggestions, 
 something which we encourage through our branches.
 
 
 
- The 
 Society has continued to operate its affinity 
 savings accounts with Norwich City, Peterborough 
 United and Lincoln City football clubs. So far, 
 through these accounts, our members have raised 
 a total of over £1,000,000 for the Clubs 
 since the first account was opened in 1997. In 
 September, we launched a further affinity account 
 with Bedford Blues Rugby Club.
 
 
 
- In 
 September, we entered a sponsorship arrangement 
 with UKVillages, the only national community website 
 that provides a home page tailored for each village 
 and town in our region. The website has been designed 
 to bring local businesses and communities together 
 and to keep them informed of what's going on, 
 where to go and what to do in their area. The 
 Society's Internet banking service can also be 
 accessed via the site.

Explanation 
 of Ratios:
 
 
 
 1 
 Gross 
 capital as a percentage of shares and borrowings 
 measures the proportion which the Society’s 
 capital (defined as reserves plus subordinated 
 liabilities) bears to the Society’s liabilities 
 to investors. Capital provides a financial cushion 
 against difficulties which might arise in the 
 Society’s business and, therefore, protects 
 investors. 
 
 
 2 
 Liquid 
 assets as a percentage of shares and borrowings 
 measures the proportion of the Society’s borrowings 
 which are held in the form of cash, short term 
 deposits and government securities. These assets 
 are generally readily realisable which enables 
 the Society to meet requests by investors for 
 withdrawals, make new mortgage loans and fund 
 general business activities. 
 
 
 3 
 Profit 
 for the year as a percentage of mean total assets 
 measures the proportion which the profit after 
 taxation bears to the average total assets of 
 the Society (defined as the average of the total 
 assets at the start and end of the year). The 
 Society needs to make a reasonable level of 
 profit each year in order to maintain its capital 
 strength at a suitable level to protect investors. 
 
 
 
 4 
 Management 
 expenses as a percentage of mean total assets 
 measures the proportion which administrative 
 expenses as reported in this document (which 
 includes depreciation and amortisation) bear 
 to the average total assets. The ratio is one 
 measure of the cost efficiency of the Society. 
 
 
 
 
Independent 
 Auditors' statement to the members and depositors 
 of Norwich and Peterborough Building Society
 
We 
 have examined the Summary Financial Statement of 
 the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society Group, 
 which comprises the Summary Directors' Report, Summary 
 Statement and the related notes.
 
Respective 
 responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
 
The 
 Summary Financial Statement is the responsibility 
 of the Directors. Our responsibility is to report 
 to you our opinion on its consistency with the full 
 Annual Accounts, Annual Business Statement and Directors' 
 Report and its conformity with the requirements 
 of Section 76 of the Building Societies Act 1986 
 and regulations made under it.
 
Basis 
 of opinion
 
We 
 performed our work in accordance with the Bulletin 
 1999/6 'The Auditors' Statement on the Summary Financial 
 Statement' issued by the Auditing Practices Board 
 for use in the United Kingdom. 
 
Opinion
 
In 
 our opinion the Summary Financial Statement is consistent 
 with the full Annual Accounts, Annual Business Statement 
 and Directors' Report of the Norwich and Peterborough 
 Building Society Group for the year ended 31 December 
 2001 and conforms with the requirements of Section 
 76 of the Building Societies Act 1986 and regulations 
 made under it.

Notes
 
1. 
 The maintenance and integrity of the Norwich and 
 Peterborough Building Society web site is the responsibility 
 of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors 
 does not involve consideration of these matters 
 and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility 
 for any changes that may have occurred to the Summary 
 Financial Statement since it was initially presented 
 on the web site.
 
2. 
 Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
 preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
 may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
