 Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa;
1.2.2 Words referring
to the masculine include the feminine and neuter;
1.2.3 References to persons
include corporations;
1.2.4 Where the Borrower is made up of two or more
persons, any event referred to in these Conditions shall be deemed to have happened
if it happens in relation to any one of those persons;
1.2.5 All covenants,
agreements and declarations by two or more persons shall be deemed to be made by them

2. Payments: The Borrower covenants with the Society:
2.1 To pay the Monthly Payments or such other amount as may become payable
under these Conditions until the Whole Debt shall have been fully paid and satisfied.
Such Monthly Payments shall become due on the first day of each Month (beginning with
the first day of the month immediately following the date of the release of the Advance
monies) or on such later date in the Month as the Society shall specify.
2.2 All payments to the Society shall be made in pounds Sterling in immediately
available funds. If any sum falls due for payment on a day which is not a Business
Day it shall be made on or before the preceding Business Day. All monies payable by
the Borrower shall be paid in full without any set-off or counterclaim and (except
as may otherwise be required by law) free and clear without any deduction or withholding
whatsoever. If the Borrower is at any time required by law to make any deduction or
withholding from any payment to the Society, then the Borrower may be required by
the Society to pay to the Society such additional amount or amounts as will result
in the Society receiving the full amount it would have received had no such deduction
or withholding been required. Where the Society does require the Borrower to make
such additional payment(s) and subsequently the Society receives any credit or rebate
of part or the whole of such additional payment(s) from a third party, then the Society
will, following such credit or rebate, credit the Borrower's account with the Society
with an amount equal to such credit or rebate.
2.3 That if on the realisation of its security by the Society the net proceeds
shall not be sufficient to pay off the Whole Debt, the Borrower will immediately pay
to the Society the amount of the shortfall together with Interest at the current rate
until payment.
2.4 On the expiration of one Month's notice to that effect given by the
Society to the Borrower or immediately in the case of the Property being purchased
compulsorily or requisitioned, to pay to the Society the Whole Debt with Interest
at the current rate until payment.
2.5 To pay all Costs reasonably incurred by the Society or any Receiver
appointed by the Society in connection with the enforcement or with a view to the
enforcement of its security or in exercising all or any of its powers or remedies
arising under the Offer of Advance or otherwise:-
2.5.1 Any cost of the
Society's solicitors shall be assessed as between a Solicitor and his own Client on
a complete indemnity basis together with Interest at the current rate until payment
by the Borrower.
2.5.2 Any administrative costs or fees attributable to
work, whether legal or otherwise, relating to the enforcement or proposed enforcement
of the Society's security carried out by the Society's officers shall be assessed
by reference to the actual cost to the Society, such costs becoming immediately due
and payable by the Borrower with Interest at the current rate until payment by the
Borrower.
2.6 Time shall be of the essence as regards the payment of all monies due
from the Borrower to the Society.
3. Non Standard Payments:
The Society may in its absolute discretion in writing permit the Borrower to repay
the Whole Debt by payments other than those payable under the Offer of Advance, or
may return any payment, or give further time for payment, of any money payable under
the Offer of Advance, or otherwise make an arrangement with the Borrower as to the
method and time of any payment under the Offer of Advance. PROVIDED THAT no such arrangement
shall affect the Society's powers, or render the Society liable in damages, or otherwise
for the exercise of any such power where no such liability would have arisen if such
arrangement had not been made.
4. Appropriation and Variation of Monthly Payments:
4.1 The Society shall apply payments received from the Borrower in the
following order of priority, as appropriate to the circumstances of each case:-
4.1.1
 First, towards payment of Costs;
4.1.2 Secondly, towards payment of any
premium of insurance relating to the Property;
4.1.3 Thirdly, towards payment
of Interest; and
4.1.4 Fourthly, towards repayment of capital.
4.2 The Monthly Payment may be varied at any time and from time to time
by written notice to the Borrower from the Society so as:-
4.2.1 To take
account of and provide or allow for any variation in the Interest rate; or
4.2.2
 To take account of any variation in the Whole Debt.
5. Interest:
5.1 The Society will charge Interest on the Advance and all other sums
which become owing under the Charge by either the Yearly Interest Method or the Daily
Interest Method as set out below. The method which applies in the case of an Advance
will be set out in the Offer of Advance.
5.2 Yearly Interest Method
The Society will charge Interest on a yearly
basis in the following manner:-
5.2.1 Interest will be payable on the Advance
from the date on which the Advance cheque (or telegraphic transfer) is issued by the
Society until the following 31 December.
5.2.2 In each succeeding Year,
Interest will be charged on the balance of the Whole Debt outstanding at the end of
the preceding Year.
5.2.3 In addition, if any further sums become owing
during any Year, Interest will be charged from the date such sums become owing until
the end of that Year.
5.2.4 In the Year of repayment of the Whole Debt,
Interest will be charged on the Whole Debt outstanding at the end of the preceding
Year (and on any further sums becoming owing during that Year) up to and including
the date on which cleared funds are received by the Society to repay the Whole Debt
in full.
5.2.5 Interest will accrue from day to day but will be payable
partly in advance (if appropriate having a regard to the Payment Date) and partly
in arrears by monthly instalments during the Year (each month being treated for this
purpose as a twelfth of the Year).
5.3 Daily Interest Method
The Society will charge Interest on a daily
basis in the following manner:-
5.3.1 Interest will be calculated daily
on the balance outstanding of the Whole Debt at the end of the previous day and accrued
until such time as a payment is received.
5.3.2 Payments received will,
after being applied towards payment of costs and any premium of insurance relating
to the Property as mentioned in Condition 4, be applied towards the accrued Interest
and then towards repayment of capital.
5.3.3 Where such payment does not
cover the amount of accrued Interest the outstanding Interest will continue to accrue.
5.3.4
 The Society may on 31 December each Year add the amount of any Interest which has
accrued and is unpaid to the Whole Debt and charge Interest on it until it is paid.
The Society will notify the Borrower if it does so.
5.3.5 Upon repayment
of the Whole Debt the amount required to redeem the Charge will be the capital balance
outstanding and any accrued Interest up to and including the date on which cleared
funds are received by the Society to repay the Whole Debt in full.
5.4 The Society may vary its method of charging Interest from time to time
if it considers it reasonable to do so. The Society will give reasonable notice in
advance to any Borrower who may be affected by any such variation.
5.5 The rate of Interest shall be the initial rate or such other rate as
the Society may in its absolute discretion decide, subject to the following:
5.5.1
 A reduction in the current rate may be made without formality and so as to take effect
from such date as the Society may decide. For an increase in the current rate the
Society shall give notice in accordance with Condition 14.
5.5.2 Without
affecting sub-Condition 2.4 the Society may, by giving notice, require the Borrower
to increase the Monthly Payment being made to take account of and provide for any
increase in the current rate or to include any additional amount which the Society
may require to be paid in respect of a further advance. In any other case a variation
of the rate of Interest shall operate to increase or reduce the period of the Advance
as the case may be. 
5.6 The Society may charge Interest both before and after any judgement
to the extent permitted by law. 
6. Early Repayment:
The Borrower acknowledges that the Society has incurred certain costs in establishing
and making available the Principal Sum on the understanding that the Borrower wishes
to utilise the Principal Sum for the entire period for which it is available. Accordingly,
in the event that the Borrower serves notice on the Society at any time during the
Repayment Period that he wishes to repay the Whole Debt or any part of it plus any
Interest and other Costs which have accrued up to the date of repayment, the Borrower
will be required to pay to the Society by way of compensation (and in addition to
any other sums) such sum or sums as may be specified in the Offer of Advance.
7. The Property:
7.1 The Borrower covenants:-
7.1.1 To observe and perform all
covenants, restrictions and obligations (whether of a public or private nature) for
the time being affecting the Property or to which the Borrower may be subject, whether
as owner or occupier of the Property, and to indemnify the Society against any breach
of such covenants, restrictions and obligations.
7.1.2 To pay all rent
and other outgoings payable in respect of the Property and on demand to produce to
the Society the receipt for any such payment.

 Not without the prior written consent of the Society to make any structural alteration
or addition to the Property nor to change its authorised use.
7.1.5 Not
without the prior written consent of the Society to create any lease or tenancy or
part with possession or share the occupation of the whole or part of the Property,
and the powers of leasing or agreeing to lease and of accepting surrenders of leases
conferred on a mortgagor in possession by the Law of Property Act 1925 shall not apply
to this Charge.
7.1.6 At all times to comply with the Planning Acts and
any requirements of the Planning Authority of the Property or by the Landlord on the

third party on the Borrower.
7.1.8 To insure the Property in the joint
names of the Borrower and the Society in accordance with the provisions of Condition
8 and in addition to notify the Society in writing as soon as possible following any
event leading to, or likely to lead to, a claim upon any policy of insurance relating
to the Property. If the Borrower is in default of his obligation to insure the Property
under this sub-Condition, the Society or any Receiver may (but shall not be obliged)
to take out all relevant insurances at the expense of the Borrower.
7.1.9
 Not to do or permit anything to be done as a result of which the insurance of the
Property might become void or voidable, and not without the written consent of the
Society to effect or maintain any insurance of the Property on his own account, and
to apply the proceeds of any claim on such insurance policy towards making good the
loss or damage in respect of which the money is received or, if the Society requires,
in reduction of the Principal Sum.
7.1.10 Not without the prior written
consent of the Society to create any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, encumbrance or
security interest whatsoever over the whole or any part of the Property.

the principles of good husbandry and to comply with the provisions of the Agricultural
Holdings Act 1986 and to indemnify the Society against any charge arising under such
Act.
7.1.12 To comply with the conditions set out in the Offer of Advance
and any revised Offer of Advance so far as they remain unfulfilled.
7.1.13
(Without affecting sub-Condition 17.1.2) not to purchase any superior interest to

written consent of the Society upon such terms as the Society may in its absolute
discretion impose and in the event of any breach by the Borrower of this sub-Condition
to hold the benefit of the superior interest or new lease upon trust for the Society.
7.2 The Borrower warrants that all information supplied by him to the Society
prior to the issue of the Offer of Advance was true in all respects.

or otherwise by the insurers shall belong absolutely to the Society and it shall not
be required to account to the Borrower for such sums unless required to do so by any
binding statutory or regulatory provisions.
8.4 The Borrower shall not insure the Property on his own behalf, or through
his agency, without the prior written consent of the Society (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and then only with such insurer and on such terms
and conditions as the Society may reasonably prescribe. If the Borrower insures the
Property on his own behalf, he shall hold all monies received by him under such insurance
as trustee for the Society and, on demand by the Society, shall pay all such monies
at the direction of the Society either in or towards making good the loss or damage
in respect of which the monies have been received or in or towards the discharge of
the Whole Debt.
9. The Society’s Powers:
9.1 The Whole Debt shall be deemed to become due on the day after the date

notice being given to the Borrower:-
9.2.1 If the Borrower defaults in
any one or more of the Monthly Payments due under the Charge;

Order made against him, or (being a Company) has an Order or Resolution passed for
winding-up (otherwise than for the purposes of amalgamation or reconstruction upon

Order is presented in respect of its affairs, business and/or property, or has a Receiver
appointed in respect of the whole or any part of its undertaking;

 If the Borrower shall default in the performance or observation of any obligation
or warranty contained or implied in the Charge, these Conditions, the Offer of Advance

shall cease to be under any further obligation to the Borrower, Condition 6 shall
be deemed to apply and the Society may enter into possession of the Property (for
whatever reason) but in such case such action shall not render the Society or any
Receiver liable to account as a mortgagee in possession. Alternatively the Society
may appoint a Receiver of the Property, such appointment to be in writing, under the
hand of an Authorised Officer of the Society or by Deed. The Society may appoint one
or more Receiver or Receivers who shall have power to act jointly and/or independently.
Any Receiver so appointed shall be the agent of the Borrower for all purposes and

pets or livestock of any kind which the Borrower fails, or refuses, to remove from
the Property. (The Society shall not be liable to the Borrower for any loss or damage
to such items resulting from the Society exercising these powers, but neither shall
the exercise of these powers give the Society any form of ownership, or security rights,
or interest in such items which might otherwise result in the Charge being a bill
of sale);
9.4.6 At any time after entering into possession of the Property,
or any part of it, or appointing a Receiver, give up possession or remove the Receiver
on giving notice to the Borrower;
9.4.7 Purchase or acquire any land and

 To employ advisers, consultants, managers, agents, workmen and others as he in
his absolute discretion shall think necessary on such terms as to remuneration or
otherwise as he shall think fit;
9.5.9 To give valid receipts for all monies
and execute all assurances and things which may be proper or desirable for realising
the Property or any part or parts of it, to give and receive as agent of the Borrower

103 of the Law of Property Act 1925 shall not apply to the Charge.

or may not be a paid officer of the Society and any such Receiver may be appointed
at such salary or commission and generally upon such terms as the Board of Directors
of the Society shall think fit.
9.8 All the powers of the Receiver under these Conditions may be exercised
by the Society either as the Attorney of the Borrower or in its own right and whether
or not a Receiver shall have been appointed.
9.9 The provisions of this sub-Condition shall apply where the Borrower

rights and/or duties in respect of the Property and/or any area or structure adjacent

the Attorney of the Borrower and in the name of the Borrower and on behalf of the
Borrower on the occasion of any sale of the Property by the Society pursuant to its
powers contained in the Charge, Offer of Advance or otherwise conferred by law and
as the act and deed of the Borrower to execute and deliver any deed or instrument
which may be necessary or proper to transfer the share or shares referred to in this
sub-Condition to the purchaser of the Property or otherwise to take such steps as

Property, as the case may be, and for this purpose the Borrower appoints the Society

10.6 Any transfer will only be made to a body which adheres to the "Statement
of Practice" relating to the transfer of mortgages drawn up under the auspices of

11. Consolidation:
11.1 The restriction on consolidation of loans contained in Section 93
of the Law of Property Act 1925 shall not apply to the Charge.

mortgage on other property of his which may be charged to the Society.

Redeem any such other mortgage without redeeming the Charge.
12. Guarantor:
If there is a Guarantor of the Advance, the Borrower consents to the Society disclosing
at any time to the Guarantor details of the Offer of Advance and the conduct by the
Borrower of the mortgage account (including the position as to any arrears).
13. Policies of Life Assurance: The following shall have effect where either
a Policy of Life Assurance or an investment plan (a " Policy") shall be included in
the Society's security:-
13.1 Until the Policy shall have been legally assigned to the Society,
the Society shall have an equitable charge on the Policy and the Policyholder appoints
the Society irrevocably (subject to redemption) to be the attorney of the Policyholder
and in his name to assign, transfer, surrender or otherwise deal with the Policy and
