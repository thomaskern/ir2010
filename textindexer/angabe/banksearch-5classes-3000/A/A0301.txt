History 
 and Development 
 
Northern Rock Building 
 Society was formed on 1 July 1965 as a result of the merger of Northern 
 Counties Permanent Building Society (established in 1850) and Rock Building 
 Society (established in 1865). After such time, Northern Rock Building 
 Society merged with a number of small local building societies and, 
 prior to its conversion to a public limited company in October 1997, 
 was an amalgamation of 53 societies. 
 
The most significant 
 development in the recent history of Northern Rock was its conversion 
 on 1 October 1997 from a building society to a public limited company, 
 listed on the London Stock Exchange and authorised under the Banking 
 Act 1987. The conversion also resulted in the establishment of The Northern 
 Rock Foundation, a charitable body which is entitled to receive approximately 
 5% of the annual consolidated profit before tax of Northern Rock plc. 
 
 
Northern Rock is 
 regulated by the Financial Services Authority.

Mission 
 Statement 
 
Northern Rock is 
 a specialised lending and savings bank which aims to deliver superior 
 value to customers and shareholders through excellent products, efficiency 
 and growth.

Company 
 Strategy 
 
Northern Rock is 
 a specialised lender providing residential mortgages, secured commercial 
 lending and personal finance. Funding is obtained from both on-shore 
 and off-shore personal savings, wholesale money and debt markets and 
 from the securitisation of mortgage assets. 
 
The Northern Rock 
 strategy encompasses efficiency, growth and value for both customers 
 and shareholders. The strategy is encapsulated in our 'Virtuous Circle'. 
 
 
 
Efficiency is paramount 
 to the Northern Rock business strategy. Cost efficiency is enhanced 
 by low cost, effective distribution and enables competitive pricing. 
 Capital efficiency is achieved by optimising the use of debt and equity 
 capital and through the effective use of securitisation. 
 
By 
 growing lending and improving the mix of higher margin products, Northern 
 Rock aims to grow earnings and improve return to shareholders, at the 
 same time as providing innovative and consumer friendly products to 
 customers.

Lending 
 
 
Residential 
 Mortgage Lending 
 
Residential lending 
 represents Northern Rock's core activity and accounts for approximately 
 75% of total assets under management. Northern 
 Rock consistently achieves high levels of residential lending, aiming 
 to take a market share of net residential lending at around twice natural 
 share of stock. 
 
Northern Rock continues 
 to expand the range of residential loan products. Traditional price-led 
 mortgage loans with or without extended lock-in periods continue to 
 be attractive to many customers. Increasingly, other customers are attracted 
 to "lifestyle" products such as credit bundling or equity release products. 
 The "together" range of products combine a secured and unsecured loan 
 with a credit card facility all at one interest rate and with flexible 
 payments. The Home Equity Release Mortgage (HERM) aimed at older customers 
 who wish to utilise equity in their homes to improve their income is 
 gaining momentum. 
 
The Group's residential 
 mortgage assets are spread geographically throughout the UK, are focussed 
 primarily on customers with a credit history and have conservative income 
 multiples and loan to value ratios. The quality of the portfolio is 
 excellent with the proportion of all loans 3 months or more in arrears 
 at approximately half the UK average.

 section.

Commercial 
 Lending 
 
Northern Rock has 
 a commercial loan portfolio which comprises two elements. Commercial 
 loans secured on residential properties mainly represent loans to organisations 
 supported by government grants, such as housing associations, and residential 
 investment lending to individuals. 
 
Other commercial 
 loans are all secured on non residential property and mainly represent 
 loans to individuals or corporations to support investment in properties 
 for retail, office or industrial use. 
 
Commercial loans 
 provide a diversification of assets and enhance interest margin for 
 the Group. Northern Rock intends to grow its commercial loan portfolio 
 through enhancing distribution capacity while maintaining credit quality 
 throughout the portfolio.

 Mortgages section.

Personal 
 Unsecured Lending 
 
The group also undertakes 
 personal unsecured lending. This is 
 considered to be an area of potential profitable growth for Northern 
 Rock. Growth of unsecured lending is controlled via credit scoring techniques 
 with loans granted on ability to pay. Northern Rock will not compromise 
 risk in the pursuit of volume. Indeed a high proportion of unsecured 
 lending comes from customers with an established track record, many 
 of whom have a secured loan with Northern Rock.

 Loans section.

General 
 Insurance and Life Assurance Distribution 
 
Northern Rock distributes 
 a limited range of household insurance and payment protection products 
 primarily to residential mortgage and personal unsecured loan customers, 
 via third party providers. Under arrangements with third party providers, 
 Northern Rock receives a commission and participates in the profit (but 
 not the loss) from policies sold. 
 
Life assurance products 
 are supplied to Northern Rock's customers through a relationship with 
 Legal & General where Northern Rock introduces the customer to the insurer 
 and receives a commission for doing so. These products provide a valuable 
 source of other income.

Funding 
 
 
Northern Rock has 
 developed a diversified range of funding sources comprising on-shore 
 and off-shore retail funding, wholesale funding and securitisation. 
 
 
Retail 
 Funding 
 
Retail funds continue 
 to be an essential part of the mix of Northern Rock's funding platform, 
 making up about half of all funding. UK retail deposits come from four 
 distribution channels; branches, postal, offshore and telephone based. 
 
 
The UK retail funding 
 market has been particularly competitive in recent years as a result 
 of new entrants which has affected the flow and price of retail deposits. 
 Northern Rock has aimed to maintain its retail franchise achieving substantial 
 inflows in recent years primarily through products such as fixed rate 
 bonds (postal based) and base rate tracker accounts, which provide customers 
 with certainty as to their income.

Offshore 
 Funding 
 
Northern Rock has 
 a very successful offshore operation based in Guernsey. In November 
 1999, a first foray into Europe was undertaken with the launch of an 
 Irish deposit account. New sources of retail funding will continue to 
 be sought.

 NR Guernsey and 
 NR Ireland sections.

Wholesale 
 Funding 
 
Wholesale funding 
 has become increasingly important to Northern Rock and will continue 
 to be going forward. Established programmes include US and Euro Medium 
 Term Note programmes. During 2000 Northern Rock achieved effectiveness 
 of its US SEC registration. The diversification of sources of funding 
 available to the Group will continue with particular emphasis on Europe 
 and the United States.

Securitisation 
 
 
Securitisation is 
 the third and most recent arm of Northern Rock's funding strategy. Securitisation 
 will continue to be a significant source of funding for Northern Rock 
 supporting incremental volume growth and capital efficiency. The appetite 
 for securitised bonds, particularly of the quality of Northern Rock's, 
 remains high and this source of funding is expected to grow as a proportion 
 of funding balances.

Distribution 
 and E-commerce 
 
Northern Rock's 
 distribution focus is on providing consumer choice of how and when they 
 do business with the company. As a result, the Group has a well diversified 
 distribution network with 76 branches in key population areas, successful 
 telephone direct and postal operations, strong links with financial 
 intermediaries and a developing web-site. 
 
Approximately 70% 
 of our new mortgage business comes via the intermediary market including 
 major national networks and mortgage clubs. These loans are managed 
 through our Decision Call Centre and associated processing centre with 
 decisions communicated by telephone or internet. 
 
Northern Rock's 
 approach to e-commerce is to adopt an integrated e-commerce solution 
 focussing upon meeting real business opportunities and in particular 
 building "Business to Business" links for intermediaries, as well as 
 linking with mortgage clubs' own systems. Approximately 10% of all new 
 lending now comes via the e-commerce platform.

Savings 
 and Borrowers Pledge 
 
Savings 
 Pledge 
 
Northern Rock will 
 write to its savers every time it makes changes to interest rates on 
 their account. If the account is a notice account and rates are to be 
 reduced, the advance notice will be at least the same as the notice 
 period. 
 
Northern Rock will 
 write to its savers every time it launches a new savings product which 
 is available to the majority of its customers.
 
Northern Rock will 
 write to its savers if it changes terms and conditions on their accounts.

Borrowers 
 Pledge 
 
Northern Rock's 
 Mortgage Base Rate Pledge applies to new and existing borrowers who 
 are subject to an Early Repayment Charge and whose rate during the Early 
 Repayment Charge period is linked to Northern Rock's standard variable 
 mortgage rate. Northern Rock undertakes that during the Early Repayment 
 Charge period of the loan, the variable gross interest charged (before 
 any agreed discount or premium or on expiry of a fixed rate) will be 
 the lower of: 
 
a) the Bank of England 
 Base Rate plus 1.99%; or 
 b) Northern Rock's standard variable mortgage rate 
 
During the period 
 of the Pledge, Northern Rock undertakes to apply the appropriate rate 
 as necessary within one month of a change in the Bank of England Base 
 Rate. The Base Rate Pledge will expire once the Early Repayment Charge 
 period ends.

Financial 
 Position 
 
Northern Rock aims 
 to maintain high and profitable growth whilst retaining a low risk profile. 
 This can be seen by a demonstrable track record of high asset and profit 
 growth.

The 
 Northern Rock Foundation 
 
The establishment 
 of The Northern Rock Foundation (The Foundation) on conversion was intended 
 to express Northern Rock's commitment to its mutual history and to the 
 region from which the business has drawn much of its strength. The Foundation 
 has as its primary objective helping to improve the conditions of people 
 disadvantaged by age, infirmity, poverty or other circumstances. It 
 receives approximately 5% of the annual consolidated profit before tax 
 of Northern Rock, paid under deed of covenant. The Foundation has also 
 received non - voting and non - dividend paying Foundation shares which 
 would convert into just under 15% of the ordinary share capital of Northern 
 Rock in certain circumstances. The principal event would be a change 
 in control of Northern Rock, in which event the deed of covenant would 
 terminate.
