	 	Registration step 1 - All users: Are you an insurance broker or intermediary, a reinsurance cedant, risk manager, or commercial insurance buyer? 
	 	
	 
	 	Q: Are you an insurance broker? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: An insurance broker is a professional adviser who solicits, negotiates, advises on, arranges and/or places coverage of insurance for an insured without an agreement or contract with any specific insurance company. Although the broker usually acts as representative to the insured, he is usually remunerated by a commission from the insurer. 
In the US, only insurance brokers licenced by a State insurance regulator should choose this category. If you are accessing the website from the US, and you are not licenced by a State insurance regulator as an insurance broker, you are not a 'ceding insurance company' or a 'qualified commercial insured', you should check the box labelled 'None of the above'.

	 	Q: Are you a risk manager? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: A risk manager is an individual appointed to carry out risk management on behalf of an industrial or commercial organisation or any other organisation where the level of work is sufficient to require the services of an insurance specialist. Risk managers are often registered with a trade association such as the Association of Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (AIRMIC) in the UK. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: Are you a reinsurance cedant? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: A reinsurance cedant is an insurer who underwrites a risk and subsequently reinsures that risk in whole or in part through a reinsurer by purchasing reinsurance. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: Are you a commercial insurance buyer? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: A commercial insurance buyer is an industrial or commercial organisation or any other organisation where the level of work is sufficient to require the services of an insurance specialist. It does not include persons who are not seeking insurance cover in the course of a business. If you are not a 'commercial insurance buyer', you should check the box labelled 'None of the above'.

	 	US users: Are you a ceding insurance company, qualified commercial insured, or industrial assured? 
	 	
	 
	 	Q: Who is a 'qualified commercial insured'? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: Some, but not all, US jurisdictions will permit an insured seeking certain forms of commercial lines property and casualty insurance to procure such coverage from non-admitted insurers such as those participating in lloyds.com - provided the insured meets certain defined criteria as to financial size and insurance sophistication. 
The standards an insured must meet in order to be a 'qualified commercial insured' (also called an 'industrial insured' in some states) vary from state to state and, as previously noted, not all states recognise this concept. 
If you are accessing the website from the US, and you are neither a qualified commercial insured/industrial insured under the law of your state, nor a licenced 'ceding insurance company/licenced insurance broker' under the law of any state, you should check the box labelled 'None of the above'.
For relevant state law, see below.

	 	Ontario users: Are you a registered insurance broker or an authorised insurer? 
	 	
	 
	 	Q: Are you a 'registered insurance broker'? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: An insurance broker is a professional adviser who solicits or negotiates coverage of insurance for an insured without an agreement or contract with any specific insurance company.

	 A: A partnership or body corporate which has been approved by the Council of Lloyd's to broke insurance business at Lloyd's. Lloyd's brokers are issued with a Lloyd's broker number. Only Lloyd's brokers should choose this category. If you are not a "Lloyd's broker" and you are not a "provisionally-accredited Lloyd's broker", you should check the box labelled "Neither of the above" 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: Are you a 'provisionally-accredited Lloyd's broker'? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: A partnership or body corporate which has been provisionally approved by the Council of Lloyd's to broke insurance business at Lloyd's. 
During the first three years of accreditation by the Council, brokers may only refer to themselves as 'provisionally accredited Lloyd's brokers'. After three years a broker must apply for reaccreditation. If successful, the broker may then be referred to as a 'Lloyd's broker'. 
Provisionally accredited Lloyd's brokers are issued with a Lloyd's broker number. Only provisionally accredited Lloyd's brokers should choose this category. 
If you are not a 'provisionally-accredited Lloyd's broker' and you are not a 'Lloyd's broker', you should check the box labelled 'neither of the above'. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: Why is a Lloyd's broker number required? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: In order to comply with Lloyd's requirements, lloyds.com is required to ascertain the professional status of the Lloyd's accredited brokers who use the lloyds.com website.

	 	Q: What is a 'regulatory licence or reference number'? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: Regulatory licence or reference numbers are licence numbers issued to insurance professionals by a (state) insurance regulator. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: Why do you need my regulatory licence or reference number?

	 	Q: What if I don't have a regulatory licence or reference number? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: In many jurisdictions, insurance professionals are licenced by and registered with a (state) insurance regulator. If you are licenced/registered, you may have been issued with a regulatory licence or reference number which you should enter when prompted to do so. 
If you are accessing the website from the US or Ontario, you will have been issued with a regulatory licence or reference number. 
If you are in the US or Ontario and you are an insurance broker or insurance intermediary, and you do not have a regulatory licence or reference number, you should contact your local (state) insurance regulator or seek legal advice before completing the registration process.

	 	Q: Why does my country (or US state or Canadian Province) not appear? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: Regulatory requirements in certain jurisdictions may prohibit lloyds.com from allowing users from those jurisdictions to access the lloyds.com website. If your country (or US state or Canadian Province) does not appear in the drop-down list, you are from one of these jurisdictions. 
lloyds.com is investigating the regulatory position and hopes to be able to extend its service to include you in the near future. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: Which US state should I select? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: When prompted to select your US state, you should select the state from which you intend to procure insurance business. This will usually be the US state in which your place of business as an insurance professional is located; this may be different from the state in which your company's head office is situated. 
If you are uncertain as to what you should enter, you should seek legal advice. 
Please note that the location of any risk(s) for which you may be seeking coverage is NOT relevant for the purposes of registration, although all insurance professionals are reminded that the law of the state where the risk is located must be complied with for any and all individual placements made through lloyds.com.

	 	US users: Are you a surplus (excess) lines licensee, a producing agent/broker/producer or a reinsurance intermediary broker/manager? 
	 	
	 
	 	Q: Are you a 'surplus lines licensee'? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: A surplus lines licensee is an insurance producer with a special licence authorising the licensee to procure coverage on behalf of in-state insureds from certain non-admitted insurers deemed under state law to be 'eligible' for purposes of writing insurance on risks that the voluntary licenced insurance market is unable or unwilling to cover. 
These non-admitted insurers are generally referred to as 'eligible surplus lines insurers'. 
In the US, only surplus lines licensees properly licenced for excess/surplus lines by a state insurance regulator should choose this category. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: Are you an 'excess lines licensee'? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: See 'surplus lines licensee'. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: Are you a 'producing agent/broker/producer'? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: A producing agent/broker/producer is an insurance broker or agent who participates in the transaction between the insurer and the ultimate insured. In the US, only producing agents licenced by a state insurance regulator should choose this category. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: Are you a 'reinsurance intermediary/broker/manager'? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: A specialist intermediary involved in the placing of reinsurance. Although the activity of placing reinsurance is often not regulated, reinsurance intermediaries are usually registered with or authorised by an insurance regulator. In the US, only reinsurance intermediary broker/managers licenced by at least one state insurance regulator as a reinsurance intermediary broker or manager should choose this category.

	 	Why do I need to re-register if my status changes or otherwise update my personal details?

	 	Why has my registration been denied? 
	 	
	 
	 	Q: Why can't I register? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: Regulatory requirements in certain jurisdictions prohibit lloyds.com from allowing certain users from those jurisdictions to access Market Finder on the lloyds.com website, unless those users fulfil specific requirements as to their status as insurance professionals. 
If you cannot register, the laws in your jurisdiction may not allow us to give you access to Market Finder. Also, lloyds.com offers a service designed for insurance professionals. If you are not an insurance professional, the Market Finder facility on this website is not appropriate for you.

	 	Using Market Finder 
	 	
	 
	 	Q: What is Market Finder? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: lloyds.com's Market Finder is a sophisticated database providing insurance professionals around the globe with the ability to view information about Lloyd's underwriters and accredited brokers, as well as their products, and to make contact in a secure environment. 
It is a new site and does not yet reflect the full depth and breadth of products and services that the Lloyd's market can offer. As we work to build the database, you can find out who is currently listed by viewing the directories on the Market Finder homepage. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: How do I bring a book of business to the Lloyd's Market? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: If you have no experience of dealing with the Lloyd's market you should use Market Finder to contact Lloyd's underwriters and brokers who do business in the risk class and location that you are interested in. 
They may be interested in sponsoring your organisation as a coverholder or provisionally accredited Lloyd's broker. For a definition of coverholder views our Glossary.
For more information about becoming a Lloyd's broker visit www.lloydsoflondon.com, click on 'For Brokers' and select 'Want to be accredited?'
 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: How do I search Market Finder? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: There are two ways. From the Market Finder homepage you can either: 
 
- Navigate by selecting one of the eight risk classifications and then selecting a risk sub-classification as required; or 
- Enter the class of business you require in the crimson 'Find coverage now' box on the right of the page. It is advisable to specify a risk location at this stage. 
You will see displayed all carriers, brokers and online transactional sites that cover the selected class. Alternate between the three by clicking on the relevant tab. 
To ease browsing, if you have not yet specified a risk location, we suggest you refine your search by using the left-hand drop down box to enter your chosen territory. You will then see only those carriers, brokers and online transactional sites who cover that territory. 
You can find out more about the carrier or broker by clicking on the name of the company on the left-hand side of the screen. To find out more specific information about what services/products the selected carrier or broker can offer in this risk class, click on 'View details' on the right-hand side. 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: What does 'maximum line' mean? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: For carriers: This is the top limit a carrier will generally consider for a given class of business (in British Sterling and US dollars). 
 
For brokers: This is the top limit a broker generally believes he/she can place in the market for a given class of business (in British Sterling and US dollars). 
These figures are provided for guidance only. Carriers/brokers may provide more or less than this depending on the risk. 
 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: What does 'minimum premium' mean? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: This is the smallest premium that a carrier or broker will generally consider for this class of business (in British Sterling and US dollars). This figure is provided for guidance only. Carriers/brokers may consider more or less than this depending on the risk. 
 
	 	
	 
	
	 
	 	Q: How do I use the secure messaging service? 
	 	
	 	 
	 A: You can use Market Finder's secure messaging service to contact up to 10 carriers and brokers with a particular enquiry. All the participants contacted in this way guarantee to respond within a specified time period. 
To make contact, you must be in the 'View details' section of a relevant carrier or broker. Using one of the two crimson boxes on this page, you can contact your selected carrier/broker immediately by clicking on 'Compose Message' OR save the contact for later and continue browsing. 
 
Once you have finished saving your contacts, click on the 'Contact list' box at the top right-hand corner of the screen. On your contact list page, tick the counterparties you wish to contact and then click on 'Compose Message'. 
After composing the message click ONCE on 'Notify contacts'. A confirmation page will be displayed. 
Your contacts will be notified of the class of business and location of the risk for which you are seeking cover. 
The contacts that you have selected will then reply within their specified response time.
