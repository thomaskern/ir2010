	Overview 
	 
	
	
Switzerland's insurance sector is the 12th largest in the world. In 2000 the country generated $29.95bn in premium volume which accounted for just 1.23% of the world market. 
Swiss non-life insurers achieved a 3% rise in premium revenue in 2001 to CHF16.3bn ($9.56bn), but overall, the Swiss insurance sector reported depressed earnings.
The country's insurers are very highly regarded internationally: they have a reputation for sound financial strength and an innovative approach to business. Half Switzerland's total insurance premiums are generated abroad.
More than 80% of all Swiss insurance business is generated by four multinational firms: Zurich Financial Services, Winterthur, Swiss Re and Swiss Life. The low growth potential of their home market means Swiss insurers tend to build extensive operations abroad.
Non-life business was hit hard by a string of natural catastrophe losses in 1999. This reduced insurers' equalisation reserves, making reinsurance cover more expensive. Motor business is seeing increases in premium rates, with most companies announcing rises of 5% to 10%, although this is expected to be absorbed through increasing claims.
The Swiss spent an average of $4,643 per capita on insurance products in 1999 - a higher per capita spend than any other nation.
Ongoing deregulation means there is a broad array of insurance products available. But the implementation of the Insurance Supervisory Act - scheduled for later in 2002 - means insurers will feel the weight of increased regulation.

	Regulation 
	 
	
	
The Swiss insurance market is going through a period of regulatory change. New legislation is expected in 2002 to bring insurance law in line with the strict laws that govern Swiss banks. The regulation covers financial conglomerates with banking and insurance interests. The changes form part of Switzerland's plan to adhere to the EU's proposals for prudential supervision of financial conglomerates.
All Swiss and foreign insurers and Swiss reinsurers must be authorised and must commence business in the classes for which they are licensed within six months of authorisation. Foreign reinsurers operating in Switzerland are not supervised.
A non-life company with its head office outside Switzerland or the European Union applying for authorisation must be a joint stock company, which must have operated in its country of domicile for a minimum of three years.
A non-life company with its head office in the EU must supply a certificate from its home supervisory authority that it is constituted in a legal form authorised in its home country, that it transacts no business other than insurance and directly related operations, that it has assets free of all foreseeable liabilities corresponding to at least the minimum solvency margin and that it has transacted insurance in its home country and the risks it actually covers. It must also supply its Articles of Association.
All foreign insurers must appoint a general representative for Switzerland and supply copies of the letter and certificate of authority. The appointment must be approved by the Swiss Federal supervisory authority (FOPI).
Swiss companies must set up an organisation fund in Switzerland, represented by liquid assets, to cover the cost of setting up administrative services and the Swiss new business organisation, expenses in the event of extraordinary business expansion and to meet losses as a last resort. Consent of the supervisory authority is required for any other use of the fund.
Prior to submission of the application, all companies must agree rates, general policy conditions, surplus participation and calculation of technical reserves and reinsurance structure with the supervisory authority.
Minimum capital requirements for Swiss insurers are as directed by the supervisory authority.
 
Minimum capital for a reinsurer is CHF10m and for a captive reinsurer 20% of premiums received for own account, but not less than CHF1m.
All supervised insurers and reinsurers must file annual returns and audited accounts with the supervisory authority.
Policy conditions and premium rates for life, sickness, disability and natural perils insurances must be approved by the supervisory authority before use.
Life and non-life insurance must be transacted by separate companies.

Solvency
For non-life business and reinsurance the allocation from profits is 20%, until the fund equals 50% of capital.
If an insurer wishes to insure several classes or risks, only the class of business or risk with the highest guarantee fund requirement is taken into consideration.
Non-life insurers with a head office in Switzerland or the EU must keep in Switzerland bound assets at least to the value of the solvency margin as calculated on the basis of their Swiss business. This amount must, however, be at least half of the minimum guarantee fund. 
Non-life insurers with their head office outside Switzerland or the EU must deposit part of their assets with the Swiss National Bank as a claims guarantee. The total amount of their deposits and other financial resources located in Switzerland must always cover the technical reserves of their Swiss portfolio.
There are restrictions on the investment of assets representing claims guarantee funds.
The federal supervisory authority must approve calculation and estimation of reserves. For non-life business, unearned premium and outstanding loss reserve and, where annuities are payable, mathematical reserves are required.
All reserves must be invested in approved assets.
Non-admitted insurance
This is not permitted, except for war risks and cross-border motor insurance.
Policy issues
Most tariffs are advisory only and serve as guidelines. Workers' compensation (UVG/LAA) rates are controlled.
Policies may be written in English, but a Swiss insured can insist on receiving policy terms and conditions in one of the official language of Switzerland (German, French or Italian). The currency in which the policy is denominated may be freely chosen by the parties.
Intermediaries
Brokers are allowed to operate in Switzerland without a license but are not allowed to act on behalf of a non-admitted (unlicensed) insurer. Brokers placing with business with Lloyd's, however, must be authorised by Lloyd's itself and by the Swiss Federal supervisory authority (FOPI).
