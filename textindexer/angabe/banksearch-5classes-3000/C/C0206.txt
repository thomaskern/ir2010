	Overview 
	 
	
	
The US is by far the largest and most mature global insurance market with 45.85% share of the world market. It generated a total premium volume of $865.33bn in 2000, accounting for more than a third of the world's premium income. Non-life premiums accounted for $422.95bn in 2000.
Legislation to make insurance cover for terrorist acts available to businesses in the US was approved by the House of Representatives on November 29, 2001. The proposed legislation is part of a political effort to enable businesses to find terrorism cover following the attacks on the World Trade Center.
The legislation will not be made law until the Senate and White House find a solution to their current dispute over the details of the plan.
Congressional failure to pass federal reinsurance legislation has forced insurance regulators in 41 states to allow insurers to exclude acts of terrorism from commercial policies. In states prohibiting terrorist exclusions, such as New York and California insurers are left with little choice other than to stop selling new commercial policies, refuse renewals or drastically lower their limits of liabilty.

	Legislation 
	 
	
	
- The most significant Federal law pertaining to insurance is Public Law 15 (McCarran-Ferguson Act) of 1945, which delegates most of the regulation of insurance to the individual states.
- Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act (GLBA) of 1999 - This act is urging greater uniformity of insurance regulation.

	Regulation 
	 
	
	
The US government retains certain powers concerning the regulation of interstate commerce (ie federal anti-trust laws still apply to the insurance industry). However, via the McCarran-Ferguson Act, most regulation falls to the responsibility of the individual states (see State Commissioners of Insurance below). This includes the licensing of insurers, setting capital and surplus requirements, the regulation of rates and policy forms, and taxation. The regulations vary from state to state.
There are three classifications of insurer:
- Domestic: incorporated or residing in the state
- Foreign: incorporated or residing in another state
- Alien: incorporated or residing outside the USA.
Insurers classified as 'foreign' or 'alien', being 'admitted', may conduct business in a state under its supervision. There are separate requirements for non-admitted or 'unlicensed' insurers, which also differ from state to state.
 
There is some speculation that the McCarran-Ferguson Act will be repealed with the intention of increasing federal regulation of competition between insurers. Government intervention is currently limited to these areas:
- Nuclear insurance
- Flood insurance
- Crime insurance
- Crop insurance.
Regulatory bodies
The National Association of Insurance Commissioner promotes uniformity of supervision in state insurance matters, (see also State Commissioners of Insurance, below).
National Association of Insurance Commissioners(NAIC), 2301 McGee, Suite 800, Kansas City, MO 64108-2604, USA
Tel. (816) 842-3600

New initiatives set out in NAIC's statement of intent - "The Future of Insurance Regulation" - will assist the state insurance regulation beyond specific requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The initiatives are designed to promote uniformity and greater efficiency for agent and company licensing. They will also speed up the process for bringing new products to the market.

	Taxation 
	 
	
	
Federal premium tax
Generally premium taxes are payable by licensed insurers
Premium tax: Illinois
A surplus lines tax of three per cent is payable by the insured on surplus lines business. It is the responsibility of the Illinois surplus lines broker to collect and remit the tax and fees to the Illinois authorities.
Premium tax: Kentucky
The current rate of tax is two per cent. The insurer is liable for the tax, which is deducted from the gross premium.
In certain towns, counties and metrogovernmental units, municipal or county taxes are levied on premiums for fire, marine, casualty and surety located within such areas. It is the local broker's responsibility to collect and remit these taxes to the Attorney In Fact, in order to arrange for payment. Further information about municipal and county taxes can be obtained from the A.I.F.
