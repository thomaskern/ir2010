 Holidays 
 should be a time to enjoy yourself 
 and relax, to escape from the 
 stresses and strains of daily 
 routine. Which is why the simple 
 precaution of buying adequate 
 travel insurance is a worthwhile 
 investment. 
 
 If you need medical help on holiday, 
 are involved in an accident, lose 
 anything or have to cancel your 
 holiday at the last minute, the 
 appropriate cover saves you the 
 worry and expense you'd otherwise 
 face. 
 
 Your BIBA broker will help you 
 find the travel cover that's right 
 for you - and can probably save 
 you quite a lot of money into 
 the bargain. This section of our 
 website sets out to explain what 
 you should consider when you buy 
 travel insurance and some of the 
 pitfalls to avoid.

 CHECKLIST: 
 
 1.CANCELLATION 
 
 
 It's vital that you're covered 
 in case you have to cancel your 
 holiday. The policy will cover 
 a range of reasons for doing this. 
 These should include the following: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Illness 
 or death in your family or of 
 a business partner 
 
- Jury 
 service
 
- Serious 
 fire, flood or storm damage 
 to your home or business 
 premises
 
- Redundancy
 
- A 
 request from the police not 
 to go away following a burglary
 at 
 your home or office
 
 
 
You should be able to reclaim 
 any holiday costs you cannot 
 recover, apart from the cost 
 of insurance. Make sure the 
 policy covers both yourself 
 and your travel companions.
 
 
 
 2. MEDICAL EXPENSES 
 
 It's vital you are covered for 
 medical expenses, as hospital 
 and doctors' bills can be enormous, 
 especially in North America. 
 
 
 Most policies require you to 
 pay a small excess towards the 
 cost of treatment and medicines, 
 but will also pay benefits - 
 up to a set limit - if you have 
 to stay in hospital. 
 
 If you travel within the EU 
 you should get form E111 from 
 a Post office. This will entitle 
 you to reciprocal health service 
 care in the countries you visit. 
 However, few EU countries pay 
 for the full cost of treatment, 
 and you're likely to be treated 
 in a private clinic or hospital, 
 so it's important to have your 
 own insurance. Remember to keep 
 all doctors', hospital and chemists' 
 bills to support any claim you 
 make.
 
 Your policy should also cover 
 you for any extra accommodation 
 or travel expenses you incur 
 as a result of illness, or if 
 you have to go home early because 
 of the illness or death of a 
 close relative or business partner.
 
 3. PERSONAL ACCIDENT 
 COVER
 
 Personal accident cover will 
 pay out if you are killed or 
 permanently disabled on holiday 
 - for example, if you lose a 
 limb or your eyesight. 
 
 A few simple precautions will 
 help to keep you safe - follow 
 them, and you'll reduce your 
 risk considerably.
 
 
 
 
- Keep 
 away from dangerous areas, especially 
 at night
 
- Don't 
 spend too long in the sun - 
 wear a hat and use plenty of sun 
 block
 
- Don't 
 go swimming after a large meal 
 or drinking alcohol
 
- Check 
 the local conditions before 
 swimming in the sea - tides 
 and currents 
 can be extremely deceptive
 
- 
 If you're planning any long 
 distance walking, always inform
 someone 
 of your plans, and your expected 
 arrival times
 
- If 
 you're driving your own car, 
 always have a servicing before 
 you go
 
 
 
 
 4. PERSONAL LIABILITY 
 
 
 Most travel policies will insure 
 you against personal liability. 
 This means that if you injure 
 someone or damage their property, 
 you will be covered if they 
 decide to sue you. 
 
 5. LEGAL EXPENSES 
 
 Some policies will pay your 
 legal costs if you decide to 
 sue a third party for damages 
 as a result of personal injury 
 or death. 
 
 6. PERSONAL BELONGINGS 
 
 
 Your insurance should cover 
 your personal belongings and 
 cash against loss or damage. 
 However, insurance companies 
 expect you to look after your 
 possessions at all times - you 
 may have problems trying to 
 claim for a camera you left 
 on the beach which was stolen 
 when you went for a quick dip. 
 
 
 Most policies impose a limit 
 to the cover on any one item. 
 So it might be worth adding 
 'all risks' cover to your household 
 contents insurance and valuables 
 like jewellery or cameras. 
 
 Some policies pay a set amount 
 for the loss of a passport. 
 This should cover any extra 
 travel and accommodation expenses 
 you incur to get it replaced. 
 
 
 If you lose or have something 
 stolen, report the incident 
 to the local police within 24 
 hours, and get written conformation 
 that you have done this.
 
 Follow these tips for a thief-free 
 holiday: 
 
 
 
 
- 
 Don't leave your belongings 
 unattended
 
- Never 
 leave valuables on show in your 
 car
 
- Always 
 leave valuables in a hotel safe 
 or safe deposit box
 
- Keep 
 money, documents and valuables 
 with you when travelling
 
 
 
 
 7. DELAYS AND MISSED DEPARTURE 
 
 
 Most policies will compensate 
 you if your luggage is delayed 
 for more than twelve hours on 
 your outward journey. This will 
 enable you to buy replacement 
 items, but don't forget to keep 
 the receipts for everything 
 you buy. 
 
 You may also receive a lump 
 sum if your departure is delayed 
 or if you miss your flight for 
 a valid reason. This should 
 cover any travel expenses you 
 incur in reaching your final 
 destination. 
 
 8. ANNUAL COVER 
 
 If you're lucky enough to take 
 several holidays a year, or 
 if you travel frequently on 
 business, you should consider 
 annual travel insurance. 
 
 This type of insurance is based 
 on a yearly fee regardless of 
 the number of the number of 
 trips you make, and can be a 
 lot cheaper than taking out 
 separate cover every time you 
 travel.
 
 9. EXTENDED STAYS 
 
 A number of insurance companies 
 offer policies that cater for 
 people who take long-stay winter 
 holidays and round-the-world 
 trips.
 
 However, before you go, check 
 your household contents insurance. 
 Some policies stipulate that 
 homes should not be left empty 
 for more than 30 days without 
 informing the insurer. 
 
 10. HAZARDOUS PURSUITS 
 
 
 More and more holidays offer 
 the opportunity to enjoy a range 
 of action pursuits. Bungee jumping, 
 scuba diving, parascending and 
 motorcycling are typical of 
 the sort of activity you might 
 be offered, so talk to your 
 broker, who will be happy to 
 arrange an extension to your 
 cover.
 
 11. WINTER SPORTS 
 
 You'll need a specialist policy 
 if you're going on a winter 
 sports holiday. This will probably 
 cost twice as much as normal 
 holiday cover, due to the greater 
 risk of claims for medical expenses, 
 personal accident, piste closure 
 and ski equipment. 
 
 It's vital that you have adequate 
 cover for medical expenses - 
 it can cost hundreds of pounds 
 simply to stretcher an injured 
 skier off the slopes. Personal 
 liability insurance is essential 
 in case you injure someone else. 
 
 
 If you plan to go 'off-piste' 
 check that your policy allows 
 you to. You might also need 
 specialist cover if you go ski-jumping 
 or bobsleighing.
 
 12. PERMANENT OR RECURRING 
 ILLNESS 
 
 If you suffer from a permanent 
 or recurring illness, you must 
 tell your insurer. Some companies 
 cater specifically for people 
 in this situation, but they 
 may request a letter from your 
 doctor saying that you are fit 
 to travel. You won't get cover 
 if you have been advised against
 travelling, are within the last 
 two months of pregnancy, or 
 are travelling to obtain medical 
 treatment abroad. 
 
 13. MOTORING ABROAD
 
 If you're planning to take your 
 car abroad, you must have adequate 
 insurance before you leave the 
 country. 
 
 UK motor insurance provides 
 the minimum cover required by 
 the EU and certain other countries. 
 However, this will not be enough 
 if you have an accident. Nor 
 will it cover you for theft, 
 fire or damage to your vehicle, 
 and it may not cover your legal 
 liabilities to other people. 
 
 
 So make sure you have the same 
 level of cover that you have 
 in the UK. Check your policy 
 carefully, as some insurers 
 provide free continental cover 
 for a limited period each year. 
 
 
 Green Card
 
 Under European law, it is no 
 longer compulsory to have a 
 Green Card, which shows that 
 your policy meets the minimum 
 legal requirements of the countries 
 in the scheme. However, a Green 
 Card can still save time and 
 problems if you need to provide 
 evidence of your insurance. It 
 is also advisable to have a 
 Euro Accident Claim. 
 
 Driving in Spain
 
 If you're planning to drive 
 in Spain, you will need a 'Bail 
 Bond'. If you're involved in 
 an accident, the Spanish authorities 
 can detain both you and your 
 car while they check to see 
 if you can meet any claim for 
 damages. A Bail Bond will secure 
 the release of both you and 
 your car. If they know you're 
 going to Spain, most insurers 
 will automatically include a 
 Bail Bond in your cover. 
 
 Accidents
 
 Should you be involved in an 
 accident, you must tell your 
 insurer or their representative 
 in the country immediately. 
 Many companies issue a European 
 Accident Statement - this is 
 printed in several languages, 
 and allows drivers to exchange 
 facts without admitting liability. 
 
 
 Breakdown
 
 Even with an extended policy, 
 you might not be covered if 
 your car breaks down, but you 
 can buy a vehicle breakdown 
 policy either with your travel 
 insurance or separately. This 
 should cover you for the cost 
 of a hire car while yours is 
 being repaired, as well as roadside 
 assistance, the cost of delivering 
 spare parts and of returning 
 your car home. 
 
 Theft Precautions
 
 Don't forget that your car may 
 be targeted by car thieves, 
 so always lock it, don't leave 
 valuables on show, keep your 
 car documents with you and use 
 an anti-theft device.
 
 14. BEWARE THE PITFALLS! 
 
 
 Apart from the exclusions mentioned 
 above, there are a number of 
 pitfalls to avoid.
 
 
 
 
- 
 If you injure yourself while 
 under the influence of drink 
 or drugs, your 
 policy is unlikely to pay up.
 
 
- 
 If you're pregnant, you might 
 not be covered for any complications
 that 
 arise.
 
 
- 
 Medical expenses and personal 
 accidents caused as a result 
 of war 
 are also excluded in many policies.
 
 
- 
 Any claim you make against your 
 household insurance - for example if
 you 
 have something stolen while 
 on holiday - will risk losing 
 your no claims bonus.
 
 
- 
 Many insurers claim part of 
 any payment for possessions 
 lost or damaged 
 abroad from your household insurers, 
 which can lead to the 
 loss of your no claims bonus.
