8) The java.awt package - Layout
Objective 1)
Write code using component container and layout manager classes of the
java.awt package to present a GUI with specified appearance and resize
the behavior and distinguish the responsibilities of layout managers from those
of containers.
Note on this Objective
Although it does not mention it specifically this objective involves a
new objective compared with the 1.1 exam. This is the 
Comparing Visual Basic and Java layout
Java uses a different philosophy to layout compared with tools such as
Visual Basic or Delphi (if philosophy is not too grand an expression for laying
out a program). Most design tools use an XY pixel based approach to placing a
component. Thus in Visual Basic you can pick up a text box from the component
palette and drop it at a location on a form, and its location is set. By
contrast Java uses Layout classes to control where a component is placed
according to the current screen. 
Part of the reason for this is the cross platform nature of Java. A Java applet
may display on anything from a palm top computer to a 19 inch Sun Workstation.
I have tried writing Visual Basic applications that take account of more than
one screen resolution and it is not a trivial activity. Be warned, if you have
a background in other RAD tools you may find the Layout Manager approach a
little weird at first.
The LayoutManager philosophy
The FlowLayout manager is a good place to start as it is the default for
Applets. The FlowLayout manager simply places components on a background one
after the other from left to right. If it runs out of space to the right it
wraps around the components to the next line. 
The following code creates a very simple application and adds a series of
buttons
import java.awt.*;
public class FlowAp extends Frame{
public static void main(String argv[]){
 FlowAp fa=new FlowAp();
 //Change from BorderLayout default
 fa.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
 fa.setSize(400,300);
 fa.setVisible(true);
 }
 FlowAp(){
 add(new Button("One"));
 add(new Button("Two"));
 add(new Button("Three"));
 add(new Button("Four"));
 add(new Button("Five"));
 add(new Button("Six"));
 add(new Button("Seven"));
 add(new Button("Eight"));
 add(new Button("Nine"));
 add(new Button("Ten"));
 }//End of constructor
}//End of Application
The following image is the default appearance when you fire it up from the
command line.
Default appearance of application FlowAp
FlowAp after changing width
Bear in mind that both images are the display for exactly the same Java
code. The only thing that has changed is the width. The FlowLayout manager
automatically changes the layout of the components when the Frame is re-sized.
If you were to make the Frame very small the FlowLayout manager would change
the layout so that the buttons were wrapped around in several rows. 
When you first come across this approach to the management of components it may
seem a little arbitrary. Some of the GUI building tools such as Symantec Visual
Cafe or Borland/Inprise JBuilder offer ways of specifically placing components.
For the purposes of the exam though you must become familiar with the Layout
Manager approach to GUI creation.
Layout Managers you need to know for the exam
For the exam you need to know the following layout managers
- 
FlowLayout 
- 
BorderLayout 
- 
GridLayout 
- 
GridBagLayout
(note: the first editions of the Roberts, Heller and Ernest book on
certification say you do not need to know about the GridBagLayout, but this has
been corrected in the online errata, see my FAQ) 
Responsibilities of the layout manager vs containers
Containers and Layout Managers work in partnership. The LayoutManager
generally controls where a component is positioned. A Container will control
the default font for its components. A component may be specifically assigned a
font for itself. Questions on this seemed to come up regularly in the 1.1 exam.
You were given a text description of a Component/Container setup and then asked
what background color or font a Button or label would display.
Oddities of the BorderLayout manager
If you add multiple components to a Container that uses the BorderLayout but 
 do not pass a Constraint parameter (North, South, etc), you may get unexpected 
 results. Here is a sample that illustrates this.
import java.awt.*;
public class FlowAp extends Frame{
public static void main(String argv[]){
 FlowAp fa=new FlowAp();
 // fa.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
 fa.setSize(400,300);
 fa.setVisible(true);
}
FlowAp(){
 add(new Button("One"));
 add(new Button("Two"));
 add(new Button("Three"));
 add(new Button("Four"));
 add(new Button("Five"));
 add(new Button("Six"));
 add(new Button("Seven"));
 add(new Button("Eight"));
 add(new Button("Nine"));
 add(new Button("Ten"));
 }//End of constructor
}//End of Appl
 
 
Using the default BorderLayout
The reason you get this unexpected big button in the center is that the
BorderLayout uses a set of coordinates when arranging components. It divides
its surface area up into
- 
North 
- 
South 
- 
East 
- 
West 
- 
Center 
You might guess that the default when laying out components would be for
them to be placed clockwise around the points of the compass or some such
arrangement. Instead the designers decided to make the default the center of
the layout area. Thus in this example every button has been laid out on the
previous button, taking up the entire available area. As a result it appears
that you only have one button, the last one added.
Because the BorderLayout only divides the area up into the five mentioned
coordinates it is not the most useful of Layout Managers. However you need to
be aware of it for the exam and you need to be aware of the way it defaults to
placing all components in the center.
The GridLayout Manager
The GridLayout manager does approximately what you might expect. It
divides the surface area up into a grid and when you add components it places
them one after the other from left to right, top to bottom. Unlike the
BorderLayout and FlowLayout it ignores any preferred size of the
component. For example the preferred size of a button will be wide enough to
show its text. The FlowLayout manager attempts to ensure that a button
is this preferred size. The GridLayout has a more bondage and discipline
approach. The only thing it cares about is making sure the component fits into
the grid.
The following code lays out a set of buttons within a Frame using a
GridLayout that has been set up to have 2 rows and 5 columns.
import java.awt.*;
public class GridAp extends Frame{
public static void main(String argv[]){
 GridAp fa=new GridAp();
 //Setup GridLayout with 2 rows and 5 columns
 fa.setLayout(new GridLayout(2,5));
 fa.setSize(400,300);
 fa.setVisible(true);
 }
GridAp(){
 add(new Button("One"));
 add(new Button("Two"));
 add(new Button("Three"));
 add(new Button("Four"));
 add(new Button("Five"));
 add(new Button("Six"));
 add(new Button("Seven"));
 add(new Button("Eight"));
 add(new Button("Nine"));
 add(new Button("Ten"));
 }//End of constructor
}//End of Application
GridLayout sample
Note how the buttons are enlarged to fill all of the available space.
GridBagLayout
Peter van der Linden in Just Java and Beyond 3rd Edition describes the
GridBagLayout manager as "excessively complicated " and
doesn't recommend it. Core Java merely says "using grid bag layouts can be
incredibly complex". Whilst it is complex to use by hand, the various GUI
tools such as VisualCafe, Visual Age, JBuilder etc etc make it easier to use,
if not understand. Thus JBuilder will happily modify the add statement
to include the following details for the GridBagLayout class.
add(pAps,new GridBagConstraints2(1, GridBagConstraints.RELATIVE, 
GridBagConstraints.RELATIVE, 3, 0.0, 0.0,GridBagConstraints.CENTER, 
GridBagConstraints.NONE, new Insets(0, 0, 0, 0), -3, 45));
But when you create your code by hand it does not need to look as
complex as this.
Feedback from people who have taken the exam indicates that the questions on
the GridBagLayout are not very in-depth and a basic understanding of the
various fields of the GridBagConstraints class may well be adequate.
My favorite Java Tool is Borland/Inprise JBuilder which has its own Layout
Manager called the XYLayout manager. This seems to be easier to use than the
GridBagLayout, but if you are writing for the net it would require users to
download that additional class, causing additional overhead.
GridBagLayout is a little like the GridLayout except that different cell
rows can have different heights, and columns can have different widths. The
Java2 Docs come with a demonstration applet that
shows what can be done with the GridBagLayout manager.
In the exam this is a prime moment to take advantage of the scrap paper to
write out a grid and consider the effect of each cell. One of the problems with
the GridBagLayout is that instead of being based strictly on the underlying
grid, Java tries to guess the cells from the information given. The
GridBagLayout manager uses a helper class GridBagConstraints which has a set of
member variables that can be set to affect the appearance of each component.
The fields that you modify on the GridBagConstraints class act as
"suggestions" as to where the components will go. An instance of
GridBagConstraints is passed as a parameter with the add method, in the form
- add(component, GridBagConstraint); 
GridBagConstraints goes against the general convention in Java in that you
might expect its attributes to be configured with
setFooParam() 
methods, where FooParam might be WeightX/Y or Padding between components.
Instead it takes the form
 
GridBagLayout gbl=new GridBagLayout();
gbl.weightx=100;
If you use the GridBagLayout without the GridBagConstraints class it acts a
little like a FlowLayout, simply dropping the components onto the background
one by one.
I have created a simple demonstration applet with source that shows how
nothing much happens unless you play with the GridBagConstraints class..
http://www.software.u-net.com/Applets/GridBagDemo/GridBagTest.htm
The GridBagLayout acts a little more like the GridLayout if you use the
GridBagConstraints class and use the gridx and gridy fields to assign a
position in a "virtual" grid to each component as you add it. This
applet demonstrates this possibility. This is still a little dull and very like
the other layout managers. Things start to get much more interesting when you
start to modify other fields of the GridBagConstraints class to modify the
appearance of different components within this "virtual" grid.
Remember that although you need to understand this for the purposes of the
exam, it might be easier when programming in the real world to use a
combination of container controls added with other layout managers. An example
of when this is not an option is when you need to dynamically re-size
components. This is a situation where GUI builders such as Visual Cafe or
JBuilder are not much help and an understanding of the GridBagLayout may be
essential.
I have created a demonstration applet that
shows the affect of dynamically changing the padding parameters for a single
button in a group of buttons set out with a GridbagLayout manager
The fields for the GridBagConstraints class are
- 
gridx gridy 
- 
gridwidth and gridheight 
- 
fill 
- 
ipadx and ipady 
- 
insets 
- 
anchor 
- 
weightx and weighty 
Whilst browsing Bill Brogdens excellent Java2 Exam Cram Book I found a
pointer to a comprehensive demo of the GridBagLayout at
http://www.austria.eu.net/java/programs/applets/missgable/index.htm
Using gridx and gridy to suggest component placing
For this example you are doing some basic code to design a appointment
calendar program. It will show times down the left hand side and appointment
details down the right. The time units will be in half hour chunks.
Because an appointment may cover more than one time unit, ie may last an
hour and a half you need to be able to dynamically change the height of an
appointment to cover more than one half hour time unit. Because of this
requirement to have a varying height for the appointments, a GridLayout is not
suitable. 
You will be placing panels on the Frame as containers. The first step is to
ensure that each panel sits side by side on the main Frame of the Application.
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
public class GBCal extends Frame{
 Panel pTimes=new Panel();
 Panel pAps=new Panel();
 TextField txTimes=new TextField("09.00");
 TextField txAps=new TextField("Meet the boss");
 GridBagLayout gbl=new GridBagLayout();
 GridBagConstraints gbc=new GridBagConstraints();
 public static void main(String argv[]){
 GBCal gbc=new GBCal();
 gbc.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
}
public GBCal() {
 pTimes.add(txTimes);
 pAps.add(txAps);
 setLayout(gbl);
 gbc.gridx=0;
 gbc.gridy=0;
 pTimes.setBackground(Color.pink);
 add(pTimes,gbc);
 gbc.gridx=1;
 gbc.gridy=0;
 pAps.setBackground(Color.lightGray);
 add(pAps,gbc);
 setSize(300,300);
 setVisible(true);
 }
}
 The output will appear as follows
Note how the GridBagLayout and the GridBagConstraints classes work together.
The GridBagConstraints instance gbc gets re-used for each time a component is
added. At no point do you specifically state the number of rows and columns for
the Grid as the GridBagLayout class deduces it from the gridx and gridy fields
of the GridBagConstraints instance.
ipadx and ipady to control the internal padding of components
The code has set the background color so you can see the extent of the panel
rather than simply the width of the text fields. This is fine but now you want
the fields to stretch all the way from left to right of the main application
Frame. This can be performed by modifying the ipadx field of the
GridBagConstraints class. This is peformed by setting
gbc.ipadx=30;
For the times and
gbc.ipadx=100;
For the appointments
The result is as follows
Components within a panel with the GridBaglayout
For the next step I want to give each panel its own GridBagLayout
manager and add additional time slots and appointments. For the purpose of this
example I will add just one more time slot and simply stretch the single
appointment to cover the time slots between 9.00 and 9.30.
To do this I will create a new instance of GridBagLayout called gbBut
and use it to set up the grid for the pTimes panel to place the time
slot fields one on top of the other vertically.
The code that performs this is
 
//Control the Times panel with a GridBagLayout
pTimes.setLayout(gbBut);
gbc.gridx=0;
gbc.gridy=0;
pTimes.add(txTimes9,gbc);
gbc.gridx=0;
gbc.gridy=1;
pTimes.add(txTimes930,gbc);
Here is the complete code to the revised program
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
public class GBCal extends Frame{
Panel pTimes=new Panel();
Panel pAps=new Panel();
TextField txTimes9=new TextField("09.00");
TextField txTimes930=new TextField("09.30");
TextField txAps=new TextField("Meet the boss");
GridBagLayout gbl=new GridBagLayout();
GridBagLayout gbBut=new GridBagLayout();
GridBagConstraints gbc=new GridBagConstraints();
public static void main(String argv[]){
 GBCal gbc=new GBCal();
 gbc.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
 }
public GBCal() {
 setLayout(gbl);
 //Control the Times panel with 
 //a GridBagLayout
 pTimes.setLayout(gbBut);
 gbc.gridx=0;
 gbc.gridy=0;
 pTimes.add(txTimes9,gbc);
 gbc.gridx=0;
 gbc.gridy=1;
 pTimes.add(txTimes930,gbc);
 pTimes.setBackground(Color.pink);
 //Re-using gbc for the main panel layout 
 gbc.gridx=0;
 gbc.gridy=0; 
 gbc.ipadx=30;
 add(pTimes,gbc);
 pAps.setLayout(gbBut);
 gbc.gridx=0;
 gbc.gridy=1;
 pAps.add(txAps,gbc);
 gbc.gridx=1;
 gbc.gridy=0;
 gbc.ipadx=100;
 pAps.setBackground(Color.lightGray);
 add(pAps,gbc);
 setSize(300,300);
 setVisible(true);
 }
}//End of class
The resulting output is as followed
This has worked up to a point. We now have the two time slots, but
unfortunatly the one appointment has defaulted to the centre of the
appointments field and it is only one row thick. What I want is for it to be
anchored at the top of the appointments area and to stretch to cover both time
slots.
Anchoring components within the grid
f a component does not fill the whole area, you can specify where in the
area you want it using the anchor field of the GridBagConstraints class.
The possible values are
 
GridBagconstraints.CENTER
GridBagconstraints.NORTH
GridBagconstraints.NORTHEAST
etc etc
In this case I want to position the fields at the top (North) of the
containing panels. I have increased the depth of the Appointment field by
increasing the ipady value for the address field.
Here is the code to do this.
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
public class GBCal extends Frame{
Panel pTimes=new Panel();
Panel pAps=new Panel();
TextField txTimes9=new TextField("09.00");
TextField txTimes930=new TextField("09.30");
TextField txAps=new TextField("Meet the boss");
GridBagLayout gbl=new GridBagLayout();
GridBagLayout gbBut=new GridBagLayout();
GridBagConstraints gbc=new GridBagConstraints();
public static void main(String argv[]){
 GBCal gbc=new GBCal();
 gbc.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
 }
public GBCal() {
 setLayout(gbl);
 //Control the Times panel with a GridBagLayout
 pTimes.setLayout(gbBut);
 //Ensure the componants sit at 
 //the top of the containers
 gbc.anchor=GridBagConstraints.NORTH;
 gbc.gridx=0;
 gbc.gridy=0;
 pTimes.add(txTimes9,gbc);
 gbc.gridx=0;
 gbc.gridy=1;
 pTimes.add(txTimes930,gbc);
 pTimes.setBackground(Color.pink);
 //Re-using gbc for the main panel layout 
 gbc.gridx=0;
 gbc.gridy=0; 
 gbc.ipadx=30;
 add(pTimes,gbc);
 pAps.setLayout(gbBut);
 gbc.gridx=0;
 gbc.gridy=1;
 gbc.ipady=12;
 pAps.add(txAps,gbc);
 gbc.gridx=1;
 gbc.gridy=0;
 gbc.ipadx=100;
 pAps.setBackground(Color.lightGray);
 add(pAps,gbc);
 setSize(300,300);
 setVisible(true);
 }
}//End of class
The output of this code is as follows
GridBag items not covered by this exercise
This exercise has covered the following GridBagConstraints fields
- 
ipadx/y 
- 
gridx/y 
- 
anchor 
The GridBagConstraints class has the following important fields
- 
weightx/y 
- 
fill 
- 
gridwidth/height 
- 
insets 
 
The weight fields control how an area grows or shrinks beyond its initial
size. So if you set the weighty field to zero the field will remain a constant
height when you resize the window.
The fill field controls how a component stretches to fill the area. Like the
anchor field you set the fill values using constants of the
GridBagConstraints class. These are
 
GridBagConstraints.NONE
GridBagConstraints.HORIZONTAL
GridBagConstraints.VERTICAL
GridBagConstraints.BOTH
The gridwidth/height fields determine how many columns and rows a
component occupies.
The insets field indicates the "external" padding along the 
 cell boundaries.
