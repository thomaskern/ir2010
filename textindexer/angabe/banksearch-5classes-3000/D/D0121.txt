Question 1: Package Visibility
Assume we have the following code in the file /abc/def/A.java:
	
	1 // File: /ABC/def/A.java 
	
	2 package def; 
	
	3 
	
	4 public class A { 
	
	5 int var; 
	
	6 } // A 
And this code is in /ABC/Tester.java:
1 // File: /ABC/Tester.java 
2 import def.A; 
3 
4 public class Tester { 
	5 A a = new A(); 
	
	6 public void someMethod() { 
	
	7 a.var = 1; 
	
	8 } // someMethod() 
	
	9 } // Tester 
 Now assume that /ABC is the current directory. When we try to 
 compile Tester.java with the following command,
	
 javac Tester.java
the compiler displays this error message:
	
 Tester.java:7: var is not public in def.A; cannot be accessed from outside package
 a.var = 1;
 ^
1 error
Explain why the error message occurs and how to eliminate it.
Answer 1: Package Visibility
The error occurs because the variable, var, in the A 
class has package visibility. A member (variable or method) with package 
visibility is accessible only to classes defined within the same 
package. In the code above, class A resides in the package named 
def. The class Tester, on the other hand, resides in 
what's known as the default package. Java considers any class missing 
a package statement as being in the default package. Because 
the default package is not the same as the def package, the member 
var in class A is not accessible within the Tester 
class.
 The table below should give you an idea of how member visibility declarations 
 (i.e., public, protected, package, and private) 
 affect where a member can be referenced. Of course, package visibility is what 
 you get if none of the other three visibility modifiers are specified. 
 
	
	If a member is
	declared as... then is the member accessible within... 
	
	its own class? any class in its
	own package? any subclass in a
	different package? any non-subclass in
	a different package? 
	
	public YES YES YES YES 
	
	protected YES YES YES* NO 
	
	package YES YES NO NO 
	
	private YES NO NO NO 
 
 * When a class, 
 S, extends another class, B, every instance of S 
 contains all the members declared in B, regardless of the visibility 
 modifiers (e.g., private, protected, package, or public) 
 on those members. Even though all instances of S contain all the members declared 
 in B, they cannot necessarily refer to all of them. 
 
 Let's 
 take a look at Figure 1. This figure shows four classes: B, S, 
 T and R with class B containing a protected 
 member, "protAttrib". We'll use lower-case letters to 
 represent instances of the corresponding classes, proper. For example, assume 
 object b was created by calling new B(), and so on.
 
 An object can only refer to protected members in objects that are 
 of its own class or subclass. So, for example, object s can refer 
 to the protAttrib variable in itself or in object r 
 or in any other instances of S or R but not in any 
 instances of T or B, proper. Object b 
 can refer to the protAttrib variable in b, s, 
 t, r as well as any other instances of B, 
 S, T, and R. Object r can 
 only refer to the protAttrib in itself or other instances of R, 
 proper. Admittedly, this may be a bit hard to understand without an example. 
 See Question 2 for a concrete example using Java code. 
Question 2: Member Visibility
This question builds directly on Question 1. In the 
code that follows, take careful note of the package in which each class resides.
Assume we have the following code in the file /abc/def/A.java: 
 
 
1 
	 // File: /abc/def/A.java 
	
2 package def; 
3 
4 public class A { 
5 private int privateVar; 
6 int packageVar; 
7 protected int protectedVar; 
8 public int publicVar; 
9 } // A 
 and this code is in /abc/B.java: 
 
 
1 
	 // File: /abc/B.java 
	
2 import def.A; 
3 
4 public class B extends A { 
5 A a = new A(); 
6 C c = new C(); 
7 
8 public void someMethod() { 
9 // First, try to refer to sup's members. 
10 a.privateVar = 1; // Line 10 
11 a.packageVar = 2; // Line 11 
12 a.protectedVar = 3; // Line 12 
13 a.publicVar = 4; // Line 13 
14 
15 // Next, try to refer to this object's members 
16 // supplied by class A. 
17 privateVar = 5; // Line 17 
18 packageVar = 6; // Line 18 
19 protectedVar = 7; // Line 19 
20 publicVar = 8; // Line 20 
21 
22 // Next, let's try to access the members of 
23 // another instance of B. 
24 B b = new B(); 
25 b.privateVar = 9; // Line 25 
26 b.packageVar = 10; // Line 26 
27 b.protectedVar = 11; // Line 27 
28 b.publicVar = 12; // Line 28 
29 
30 // Finally, try to refer to the members in a 
31 // subclass of B. 
32 c.privateVar = 13; // Line 32 
33 c.packageVar = 14; // Line 33 
34 c.protectedVar = 15; // Line 34 
35 c.publicVar = 16; // Line 35 
36 } // someMethod() 
37 } // B 
 and this code is in /abc/C.java: 
 
 
1 
	 // File: /abc/C.java 
	
2 public class C extends B {} 
Now assume that /abc is the current directory. When we try to compile B.java with the following command,
 C:\abc>javac B.java
the compiler displays several error messages. For each of the labeled lines in B.java, decide whether or not a compiler error will be generated.
Answer 2: Member Visibility
When one class extends another class, instances of the subclass will contain their 
own copies of all members declared in the superclass (including any private 
variables). In the example above, all instances of B will contain 
all four of the variables declared in A. However, not all of these 
variables will be accessible (i.e., visible) by instances of B.
In the descriptions below, we say a variable is inherited by a subclass if it is accessible to (in other words, it can be referred to) instances of the subclass.
a.privateVar = 1; // Line 10
 private members are only accessible 
 from within the class in which they are declared. Because privateVar 
 was declared in class A, it is not accessible from within instances 
 of class B. The following compiler error results: 
 
B.java:10: privateVar has private access in def.A
 a.privateVar = 1; // Line 10
 ^
a.packageVar = 2; // Line 11 
 package members are only accessible 
 to classes within the same package as the class that declares them. In this 
 case, the member packageVar, is declared in class A, 
 in the def package. packageVar is accessible only 
 from within classes in the def package. Since B is 
 in the "default package" (i.e., it has no package statement) it 
 does not have access to packageVar. The following compiler error 
 results: 
 
B.java:11: packageVar is not public in def.A; cannot be accessed from outside package
 a.packageVar = 2; // Line 11
 ^
a.protectedVar = 3; // Line 12 
 Even though class B extends class 
 A, instances of B are not allowed access to protected 
 members in instances of A, proper. Because field a 
 is an instance of A, proper, a instances of B do not 
 have access to its protected members. Instances of class B 
 can only access protected members in instances of classes that 
 are of type B. This includes classes that inherit from B 
 (such as the C class). The following compiler error results: 
 
B.java:12: protectedVar has protected access in def.A
 a.protectedVar = 3; // Line 12
 ^
a.publicVar = 4; // Line 13 
 
public members are available "everywhere". Consequently, B's 
 reference to a.publicVar compiles without error.
privateVar = 5; // Line 17
 private members are only accessible 
 from within the class in which they are declared. Because privateVar 
 was declared in class A, it is not accessible from within instances 
 of class B. Note that on Line 10 we attempted to refer to a private 
 member in another object (object a). On line 17 we are attempting 
 to refer to the copy of privateVar that B contains 
 by virtue of being a subclass of A. In terms of the visibility 
 of privateVar, however, it does not matter. privateVar 
 is a private member declared in the A class and can 
 only be accessed from within that class. The following compiler error 
 results: 
 
B.java:17: privateVar has private access in def.A
 privateVar = 5; // Line 17
 ^
packageVar = 6; // Line 18 
 As was true for line 11, package members are only 
 accessible to classes within the same package as the class that declares them. 
 Here an instance of B is trying to access the packageVar 
 variable it contains by virtue of being a subclass of A. The protectedVar 
 variable, however, was declared by a class in the def 
 package. Recall that B is not in the default package. Therefore, 
 B cannot access the packageVar member. The following 
 compiler error results:
 B.java:18: packageVar is not public in def.A; cannot be accessed from outside package
 packageVar = 6; // Line 18
 ^
 protectedVar = 7; // 
Line 19 
 There is no compiler error for line 19. Remember 
 that a protected member declared in a class, R, is accessible 
 within: 
 
 
- any instance of any class in the same package 
 as R (this is exactly the same restriction that applies to package 
 members)
	 
- an instance, m, of any class, M, 
 such that a reference of type M is assignable to a reference of type 
 R.
 
 The language here is getting a bit abstract. In our coded example above, class 
 R is represented by class A and class M is represented 
 by class B. Instance m is simply an instance of B. 
 Since B extends A, an object of class B 
 can certainly be assigned to a reference of type A. 
publicVar = 8; // Line 20 
 As was the case with line 13, public 
 members are available "everywhere". Consequently, B's reference 
 to publicVar compiles without error.
b.privateVar = 9; // Line 25 
 As was the case with lines 10 and 17, the member, 
 privateVar, is declared in class A and can therefore 
 only be accessed by instances of class A, proper (i.e., in object 
 of class A, but not any of its subclasses). The following compiler 
 error results:
 B.java:25: privateVar has private access in def.A
 b.privateVar = 9; // Line 25
 ^
b.packageVar = 10; // Line 26 
 As was the case with lines 11 and 18, the member, 
 packageVar, is declared in class A which is in the 
 def package. Only instances of classes in the same package as class 
 A can access the package variable, packageVar. Remember 
 that because the B class does not have a package statement 
 it is placed in the default package. The following compiler error results:
 B.java:26: packageVar is not public in def.A; cannot be accessed from outside package
 b.packageVar = 10; // Line 26
 ^
 b.protectedVar = 11; // 
Line 27 
 You may want to refer back to the description 
 of line 19. Generically speaking, if we have 
 a class (call it R) that contains a protected member (call 
 it p) and another class (call it M) extends R, then 
 any instance of M can access the p contained in any other 
 instance of M, including instances of subclasses of M. 
 
 Once again, in this coded example, class R is class A, 
 class M is class B, and p is the protected 
 member, protectedVar. Line 27 is an example of an instance of 
 B attempting to reference a protected member in 
 another instance of B (the member, b.protectedVar). 
 Since an instance of B is attempting to reference a protected 
 member in another instance of B, the line compiles cleanly. 
b.publicVar = 12; // Line 28 
 As was the case with lines 13 and 20, public 
 members are available "everywhere". Consequently, B's reference 
 to b.publicVar compiles without error. 
c.privateVar = 13; // Line 32 
 As was the case with lines 10, 17, and 25, the 
 member, c.privateVar, is declared as private in class 
 A and can therefore only be accessed by instances of class A, 
 proper (i.e., non-subclasses of A). The following compiler error 
 results: 
 B.java:32: privateVar has private access in def.A
 c.privateVar = 13; // Line 32
 ^
c.packageVar = 14; // Line 33 
 As was the case with lines 11, 18, and 22, the 
 member, c.packageVar, is declared in class A which 
 is in the def package. To access this member the class attempting 
 the access (B, in this case) must be in the def package. 
 Remember that since B does not have a package statement 
 it is placed in Java's default package. The following compiler error 
 results: 
 B.java:33: packageVar is not public in def.A; cannot be accessed from outside package
 c.packageVar = 14; // Line 33
 ^
c.protectedVar = 15; // Line 34 
 You may want to refer back to the descriptions 
 of lines 19 and 27. 
 Actually, this line compiles cleanly for exactly the same reason line 27 compiled 
 cleanly. Remember that class C extends class B. Consequently, 
 any instances of C are also considered instances of B. 
 Another way to look at this is that the object, c, could be assigned 
 to a reference of type B, meaning that object c "is 
 a B".
c.publicVar = 16; // Line 35 
 As was the case with lines 13, 20 and 28, public 
 members are available "everywhere". Consequently, B's reference 
 to c.publicVar compiles without error. 
Question 3: Anonymous Subclass
Assume we have the following code in the file abc/A.java:
1 
	 // File: abc/A.java 
	
2 
	 package abc; 
	
3 
4 public class A { 
5 protected int protectedVar; 
6 } // A 
and this code is in the default package: 
1 // File: Tester.java 
2 import abc.A; 
3 
4 public class Tester { 
5 private A z = new A() { 
6 void someMethod() { 
7 protectedVar = 1; // will this compile?? 
8 } // someMethod() 
9 }; 
10 } // Tester 
Determine whether or not the assignment statement in Tester will 
 compile successfully. Assume the directory, /abc, is in the compiler's classpath 
 when compiling Tester.java.
Answer 3: Anonymous Subclasses
Both classes compile cleanly. You may wonder why the assignment statement seems 
 to compile cleanly since it appears that a protected member is 
 being accessed from within a class (Tester) that does not extend 
 the class which declared the protected member (class A). 
 Specifically, it may seem strange that class Tester has access 
 to protectedVar since Tester does not extend A 
 and the two classes are in different packages.
In actuality, the reference to protectedVar is not taking place 
 within Tester at all! Note the declaration of the variable z 
 within Tester. What type of object would you say that z is? The answer: z is an instance of a subclass of A, so z is also an instance of A. What's the name of this subclass? Well, it doesn't have a name -- it's an anonymous 
 subclass. The important thing to realize is that since z is of a type which extends A, z has access to the protected members 
 in A. This situation is exactly the same situation we saw in Question 
 2, line 19.
 The result of compiling the above code is three separate class files: A.class, 
 Tester.class, and Tester$1.class. Tester$1 is the name the Java compiler assigned 
 to the anonymous subclass of A.
Question 4: Method Overriding I
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code:
1 public class Tester { 
2 public static void main(String[] args) { 
3 System.out.println(new Sub().g()); 
4 } 
5 private int f() { 
6 return 2; 
7 } 
8 int g() { 
9 return f(); 
10 } 
11 } // Tester 
12 
13 class Sub extends Tester { 
14 public int f() { 
15 return 1; 
16 } 
17 } // Sub 
Answer 4: Method Overriding I
The output is:
 
2
The important point to note about this code is that the method Tester.f() 
is not overridden in class Sub. So long as Tester.f() 
has private visibility, it cannot be overridden by any 
subclass of Tester. The fact that class Sub has a method 
whose name happens to be f() and which happens to return an int 
is completely irrelevant and unrelated to Tester's version of f(). Sub.f() does not override the method, Tester.f(). 
Now, imagine for a moment that Tester.f()'s visibility was changed 
 to something other than private. In such a case, Tester.g()'s 
 call to f() would use Java's "dynamic method lookup mechanism" 
 (analogous to the C++ v-table) to determine which version of f() 
 should be called, which, in this case would be Sub.f(). But because 
 Tester.f() is private (and therefore, cannot be overridden), 
 the Java compiler does not generate code to use dynamic method lookup when compiling 
 Tester.g()'s call to f(). Instead, the compiler generates a direct (non-overridable) call to Tester's version of f().
Note that if you were to change Tester.g()'s definition to this:
1 int g() { 
2 return ((Sub)this).f(); 
3 } 
the output of the program would be 1. Of course, you would never, 
ever, ever want to cast this to a subclass type 
as shown here. I'm only suggesting it to illustrate the fact that Sub.f() 
is accessible.
Question 5: Basic Conversions I
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code:
 
1 public class Tester { 
2 public static void main(String[] args) { 
3 System.out.println(4 + " " + 2); 
4 System.out.println(4 + ' ' + 2); 
5 } // main() 
6 } // Tester 
Answer 5: Basic Conversions I
The output is:
 
4 2
38
The first line of output is probably not too surprising. The second line is 
 a result of Java's binary numeric promotion rules. The '+' 
 operator is a binary operator (meaning it takes two operands). Java will convert 
 each operand of a binary operator to the "widest type" operand, or to an int, whichever is wider. In this case we have three operands: two ints and a char. The int type is the widest type so the char is converted to an int and the addition proceeds, using the Unicode value for the space character (32). Effectively, the addition proceeds as 4 + 32 + 2.
To review how Java converts between primitives, see the "Binary Numeric Promotion" tidbit in the Java 
 Tidbits article.
Question 6: Conditional Operator Details
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code:
 
1 public class Tester { 
2 public static void main(String[] parms) { 
3 int i = 10; 
4 i == 10 ? equals10() : notEqual10(); 
5 } // main() 
6 
7 private static int equals10() { 
8 System.out.println("result is 10"); 
9 return 10; 
10 } // equals10() 
11 
12 private static int notEqual10() { 
13 System.out.println("result is NOT 10"); 
14 return -1; 
15 } // notEqual10() 
16 } // Tester 
Answer 6: Conditional Operator Details
The output is:
 
Tester.java:4: not a statement
 i == 10 ? equals10() : notEqual10();
 ^
1 error
This was a tricky one. The fact is that the JLS 
 2 (§15.25) 
 indicates that "it is not permitted for a conditional expression to appear 
 in any context where an invocation of a void method could 
 appear."
The idea here is that a conditional expression (a ? b : c) always 
 evaluates to some value (either b or c). The JLS requires 
 that that value be assigned or used in some way. If we add an assignment operator, 
 for example, to the above conditional expression, all will be fine:
4 i = i == 10 ? equals10() : notEqual10(); 
Question 7: Basic Conversions II
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code:
 
 
1 public class Tester { 
2 public static void main(String[] args) { 
3 byte b = -1; 
4 b = (byte)(b >>> 4); 
5 System.out.println(b); 
6 } // main() 
7 } // Tester 
Answer 7: Basic Conversions II
The output is:
 
-1
The fact that it's necessary to cast the result to a byte should 
 provide a clue as to what's going on here.
b is a byte that starts out with a value of -1 (taking 
 into account the fact that a byte is 8 bits in length, b's 
 bit pattern is 0xFF).
Before the right-shift operation takes place, b is promoted to 
 an integer according to Java's rules for binary numeric promotion. 
 Taking into account the fact that integers have 32 bits, B's resulting 
 bit pattern then becomes 0xFFFFFFFF.
After the unsigned shift operation completes, the result, 0x0FFFFF, 
 is assigned back to b. When this result is cast back to a byte 
 only the low-order 8 bits of 0x0FFFFFFF are assigned to b, 
 leaving b with its original value of -1.
 
Question 8: Unwinding Compound-Assignment Operators
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code:
1 public class Tester { 
2 public static void main(String[] args) { 
3 int i = 0; 
4 byte b = 0; 
5 
	 b += b - (i = 0xffffffc9); 
	
6 System.out.println(Integer.toHexString(b)); 
7 } // main() 
8 } // Tester 
Answer 8: Unwinding Compound-Assignment Operators
The output is:
 37
This question illustrates use of one of Java's arithmetic compound-assignment 
 operators (+=). There are a total of five of these operators: (+=, 
 -=, *=, /=, and %=).
To interpret the execution of these operators you need to see them as the Java 
 compiler sees them. Below, assume var represents the variable being 
 assigned to by one of the arithmetic compound-assignment operators. Let op= 
 denote the compound-assignment operator being used and exp be the expression 
 on the right side of the arithmetic compound-assignment operator. Finally, let 
 T denote the type of the varable var.
Using the notation we just defined, an arithmetic compund-assignment statement 
 has this general form:
 var op= exp; 
where op is one of +, -, *, 
 /, or % and var is of type T.
 
 Java interprets such statements as if they had been written:
 
var = (T)(var op (exp));
Referring back to our example code, the Java compiler treats the following 
 statement:
 
b += b - (i = 0xffffffc9);
as if it had been written:
 
b = (byte)(b + (b - (i = 0xffffffc9)));
 
Question 9: Object Construction I
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code:
1 class A { 
2 public A() { 
3 System.out.println("AAA"); 
4 } // A() 
5 
6 { 
7 System.out.println("456"); 
8 } 
9 } // A 
10 
11 
12 public class B extends A { 
13 B() { 
14 this(12); 
15 System.out.println("BBB"); 
16 } // B() 
17 
18 B(int x) { 
19 System.out.println("CCC"); 
20 } // B() 
21 
22 { 
23 System.out.println("123"); 
24 } 
25 
26 public static void main(String[] args) { 
27 new B(); 
28 } // main() 
29 } // B 
Answer 9: Object Construction I
The output is:
 
456
AAA
123
CCC
BBB
The first statement to be executed in any Java constructor will always 
 be one of the following: 
 
	 
- A call to another constructor in the same class using the "this();" 
 notation. For example, this(parm1, parm2, parm3);
	 
- A call to a constructor in the super class using the "super();" 
 notation. For example, super(parm1, parm2, parm3);
	 
- If neither of the above two cases applies the compiler inserts an implicit 
 call to the superclass no-arg constructor as the first statement: super();
 
From the above three cases it should be clear that if some class B extends 
another class, A, calling B's constructor will result in one 
of A's constructors being executed in its entirety before the 
second statement is B is ever executed.
Once a class' base class constructor has completed executing, any instance initializers 
defined by the class are executed, in the order in which they are defined. After 
all instance initializers have executed the constructor body finally executes.
Using the example code above, the following events occur: 
 
	 
- On line 27, B's no-arg constructor is invoked from main().
	
- The B() constructor makes a call to another constructor (B(int)) 
 on line 14 using the "this()" notation: this(12);.
	 
	
- The B(int) constructor does not call another constructor in 
 the same class nor does it explicitly call a constructor in the base 
 class. Therefore, the compiler inserts an implicit call to A's 
 no-arg constructor as the first statement in the constructor defined on line 18.
	 
	
- The A() constructor does not call another constructor in the 
 same class nor does it explicitly call a constructor in the base 
 class (java.lang.Object). Therefore, the compiler inserts 
 an implicit call to java.lang.Object's no-arg constructor as the first 
 statement in the constructor defined on line 2.
	
- After java.lang.Object's no-arg constructor returns, all instance 
 initializers in A are then executed in the order in which they appear. Since A has only one instance initializer (line 6), this results in the string 
 "456" being printed.
	
- After A's instance initializer completes, the body of A's constructor defined on line 2 executes, printing the string, "AAA".
	
- Once A's constructor completes, control is returned to the B(int) 
 constructor. But before the body of that constructor executes B's 
 instance initializers must be run. Since B has only one instance initializer on line 22, this results in the string 
 "123" being printed.
	
- After B's instance initializer completes, the B(int) 
 constructor body resumes on line 19, printing the string, "CCC".
	
- Finally, control returns back to line 15 of B's no-arg constructor which 
 prints, "BBB".
	
 
Question 10: Object Construction II
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code:
 
 
 
1 class A { 
2 public int Avar; 
3 public A() { 
4 System.out.println("AAA"); 
5 doSomething(); 
6 } // A() 
7 
8 public void doSomething() { 
9 Avar = 1111; 
10 System.out.println("A.doSomething()"); 
11 } // doSomething() 
12 } // A 
13

Answer 10: Object Construction II
The output is:
 
AAA
Bvar=0
BBB
Bvar=2222
Avar=0
The key to understanding this example is to observe that when the doSomething() 
 method is invoked from within A's constructor, it is actually B's 
 version of doSomething() that is being invoked. But since B's 
 instance initializers have not yet executed the variable Bvar still 
 has its default value of zero (which accounts for the Bvar=0 output).
 
 It is only after control returns from A's constructor 
 that B's instance initializers are allowed to execute, thereby 
 initializingBvar to 2,222. By the time the B() constructor 
 calls doSomething() the instance initializer has already initialized 
 Bvar to 2,222 (which accounts for the Bvar=2222 output).
The lesson to be learned from this example is that you must be very careful when calling non-private or non-final methods from within a constructor because a subclass could override the methods you think you're calling.
Because class A called the doSomething() method from its constructor, class B was able to override doSomething(), thereby preventing Avar from being properly initialized to 1,111.
Question 11: Static Members and Null References
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code:
 
 
1 class A { 
2 static A createA() { 
3 return new A(); 
4 } // createA() 
5 } // A 
6 
7 
8 public class Tester { 
9 public static void main(String[] parms) { 
10 A aVar = null; 
11 System.out.println(aVar.createA().hashCode()); 
12 } // main() 
13 } // Tester 
Answer 11: Static Members and Null References
The code compiles and runs without any problems. A sample run of this code produces:
 
2765838
The fact that the variable, aVar, is null does not 
 cause a problem. When accessing a class' static members, Java only considers 
 the type of the referencing identifier, not its value. In our example 
 the referencing identifier is aVar and its type is A. 
 The fact that aVar's value is null is irrelevant.
 
 Incidentally, your output from this program will probably be different. The 
 lesson to take away from this example is that a NullPointerException 
 will not be thrown due to aVar being null.
Question 12: When Static Initializers Detour
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code (assume 
class A is the class to be executed):
 
 
1 public class A { 
2 static String a = "aaa"; 
3 static String b = new B().sayHi_B(); 
4 static { 
5 System.out.println("A.static: A's vars are: {" + A.a + ',' + A.b + '}'); 
6 } 
7 void sayHi_A() { 
8 System.out.println("A.sayHi(): A's vars are: {" + A.a + ',' + A.b + '}'); 
9 } // sayHi_A() 
10 public static void main(String[] parms) {} 
11 } // A 
12 
13 
14 class B { 
15 static { 
16 System.out.println("B.static #1: A's vars are: {" + A.a + ',' + A.b + '}'); 
17 new A().sayHi_A(); 
18 System.out.println("B.static #2: A's vars are: {" + A.a + ',' + A.b + '}'); 
19 } 
20 String sayHi_B() { 
21 return "Hi"; 
22 } // sayHi_B() 
23 } // B 
Answer 12: When Static Initializers Detour
The output is:
 
B.static #1: A's vars are: {AAA,null}
A.sayHi(): A's vars are: {AAA,null}
B.static #2: A's vars are: {AAA,null}
A.static: A's vars are: {AAA,Hi}
What's happening here is actually pretty straight forward. A's 
 static initializers begin executing at line 2. At line 3 a new instance of B 
 is created. Before this instance can be created, however, B's static 
 initializers need to run. The first line of output is produced by B's 
 static initializer at line 16. So far, nothing here should be too surprising.
At line 17 a new instance of A is being created. But how can A 
 be instantiated when A's static initializers have not completed? 
 Remember, the reason line 17 is being executed in the first place is because 
 A's static initializer (line 3) is trying to create an instance 
 B. It turns out that Java will allow an instance of A 
 to be created, even though its static initializers have not completed. Any static 
 variables in A that have not been initialized when the instance 
 of A is created will simply have their default value (0, null, 
 0.0, false, etc., depending onthe type of the variable). We can see this from the second line of output 
 produced by line 8: The variable, A.b is still null. 
 After sayHi_A() has completed execution we return to line 18 which 
 is responsible for the third line of output. At this point, B's 
 static initializers have completed and a new instance of B can 
 be created created (remember, line 3 is still executing) and the sayHi_B() 
 method can run. Finally, the last static initializer in A (at line 
 4) begins executing, producing the fourth line of output.
To summarize, a static initializer in A forced B's 
 static initializers to be executed. During B's static initializer 
 execution, however, an instance of A was created. Java allowed 
 this instance of A to be created even though A's static 
 initializer had not completed. After B's static initializers completed, 
 A's static initializers were resumed (even though an instance of 
 A had already been created by B's static initializer).
Question 13: Precedence Check I
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code and explain 
which, if any, of the casts on lines 6 through 9 are needed to avoid a compiler 
error:
 
 
 
1 public class Tester { 
2 public static void main(String[] parms) { 
3 long l; 
4 int i1, i2, i3; 
5 
6 l = (long)0x3A895E2647L >>> 4; 
7 i1 = (int)(0x3A895E2647L) >>> 4; 
8 i2 = (int)(0x3A895E2647L >>> 4); 
9 i3 = (int)0x3A895E2647L >>> 4; 
10 
11 System.out.println(Long.toHexString(l)); 
12 System.out.println(Integer.toHexString(i1)); 
13 System.out.println(Integer.toHexString(i2)); 
14 System.out.println(Integer.toHexString(i3)); 
15 } // main() 
16 } // Tester 
Answer 13: Precedence Check I
The output is:
 
3a895e264
895e264
a895e264
895e264
The answer to this question boils down to remembering Java's precedence of 
 operations and knowing a little about the shift operators. The first point to 
 realize is that the resulting type of a shift operation will always be the type 
 of the left operand (JLS 
 2, §15.19), 
 after applying unary numeric promotion 
 to each operand. Since we are shifting a long in each of lines 
 6 through 9, the result of the shift operation will be a long. 
 Consequently, only line 6 does not require a cast (since the resulting 
 long is being assigned to a long).
The output produced by line 11 should require no explanation -- it is the result 
 of a simple shift operation with no type conversions or data truncation. To 
 understand the output from lines 12 through 14 you need to realize that the 
 cast operation has a higher precedence than the shift operator. Lines 7 and 
 9, therefore, cast the value to be shifted (0x3A895E2647L) to an 
 int before performing the shift operation. Line 8, however, 
 performs the shift operation first and then casts the resulting long 
 value back to an int, which is reflected in the output produced 
 by line 13.
Question 14: Getting the "Superinterface" of an Interface
Determine the result of attempting to compile and run the following code:
 
 
1 public class Tester { 
2 public static void main(String[] args) { 
3 Class superclass = Z.class.getSuperclass(); 
4 if(superclass == null) 
5 System.out.println("superclass is null"); 
6 else 
7 System.out.println("superclass is " + superclass.getName()); 
8 
9 Class[] interfaces = Z.class.getInterfaces(); 
10 for(int i = 0; i
