Welcome to The Classical MP3 Portal!
The Classical MP3 Portal, previously a web listing for classical MP3.COM artists has re-launched as a new classical music portal. Its aim is to provide community and curatorial expertise to the new world of real classical music online. 
The Classical MP3 Portal is your guide to the great classical music available today legally from real classical music performers. The Classical MP3 Portal is agnostic about MP3 provider only looking for the absolute best in complete classical recordings. Complete performances, great performances! Find the best classical MP3's without having to filter through the thousands of pretend classical, pop music. Great Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt, Bach and Chopin MP3's, legally provided by great artists using the Internet for their own music distribution services. 
The Classical MP3 Portal is administered by noted composer, Jeff Harrington and is enlisting curatorial expertise from the online classical music world. Harrington believes that the world of classical music will thrive on the Internet if it can be protected from charlatains and the confusion created by self-promoting pop musicians and amateurs. 
The Classical MP3 Portal is currently one of the more visited classical music web sites (click on Stats to see just how many visits). The administrators hope to grow that audience into a userbase which can help advance the cause of real classical music. The Classical MP3 Portal is a curated listing of the best composers and performers who make available (by pay or for free) complete online music experiences. Classical MP3 sites that are not the best of the best will not be found here!
The Classical MP3 Portal will not feature any web site. The site must have truly compelling performances, great classical music in a complete form. No teasers for CD sales; complete compositions by classical music performers and composers. No pop music! Great Bach MP3's and Chopin MP3's. Great Beethoven MP3's and Mozart MP3's. All legal, all complete performances of classical music. 
The web will revolutionize classical music distribution, opening up the classical music world to a wider and more diverse audience. But this new audience is helpless with the incredible numbers of performers claiming to be "classical" or featuring pop music as classical music. Also, the number of amateur performers pretending to be professionals creates a huge amount of confusion. The Classical MP3 Portal features only professionals. People who have dedicated their lives to classical music and who are promoting their phenomenal talent though the legal distribution of their performances. 
By curating the classical MP3 music listing and only featuring the best, The Classical MP3 Portal hopes to open the web to the wide expanse of truly classical musicians and composers." 
Support great Classical MP3 artists by listening!

 Soft Launch for the NetNewMusic Portal 
Posted by: Jeff Harrington on Tuesday, January 29, 2002 - 08:48 AM EST 
 Jeff Harrington writes "Saturday, January 26, 2002, NetNewMusic, previously a web listing for new music resources was launched as a new music portal. Its aim is to provide community and curatorial expertise to the wild wild world of independent non-pop, extreme indy, experimental musics. 
NetNewMusic is administered by noted composer, Jeff Harrington and is enlisting curatorial expertise from the online new music world, including Steve Layton and David Drexler. NetNewMusic is loosely affiliated with the Kalvos and Damien's New Music Bizarre radio show and online music community. 
The web will revolutionize new music distribution, opening up the new music world to a wider and more diverse audience. But this new audience is helpless with the incredible numbers of composers claiming to be "experimental" or featuring pop music as art music. 
By curating the new music listing and only featuring the best, NetNewMusic hopes to open the web to the wide expanse of truly new non-pop/extreme indy musics. "
