Device programming with MIDP, Part 1 
 The concepts behind MIDP APIs and J2ME to build cross-wireless-platform 
 apps 
 Summary
 Without too much platform customization or rework, vendors can use MIDP-compliant 
 devices to develop applications that can run on multiple wireless platforms. 
 This article, the first in a three-part series, introduces you to the concept 
 of MIDP APIs and the J2ME platform. You will be exposed to the APIs used to 
 generate graphical, form-based, storage-driven code that is capable of connecting 
 with external resources. (3,500 words) 
By Michael Cymerman 
If you've been following the wireless industry, you've noticed the speed at 
 which a technology runs through its life cycle. A brand new product can become 
 obsolete within months due to an improved technology or platform. The result 
 of that rapid change has been the lack of standardization between the deployment 
 platforms in the wireless world. A development team currently needs its staff 
 to understand numerous markup languages and processes in order to deploy a product 
 onto multiple devices. A marketing department continually needs to modify product 
 direction based on the changing marketplace. 
 Devices that are compliant with Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) will 
 enable vendors to develop applications that can run on multiple wireless platforms 
 without spending intensive amounts of energy customizing or reworking each platform. 
 That would, in turn, let developers focus their energies on the system's functionality. 
 This article is the first in a three-part series designed to introduce you 
 to the concept of MIDP APIs and the Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) platform. I 
 will expose you to the APIs used to generate graphical, form-based, storage-driven 
 code that can connect with external resources. 
 Introduction to J2ME 
 The J2ME is Sun Microsystems's attempt to port the Java programming language 
 to devices with resource limitations. A mobile phone, which lacks the computational 
 power, memory, and workstation power, cannot perform the same functionality 
 as high-end servers or client workstations. 
 The J2ME platform is built upon the Java programming language to provide the 
 maximum functionality available on the resource-limited device. A subset of 
 the base functionality is provided along with some specialized classes. 
 In this article, I will focus on the CLDC (Connected Limited Device Configuration) 
 and MIDP classes. Those sets of classes make up a profile in the J2ME 
 terminology. That profile is based on the extremely limited device memory, processor 
 speed, battery, and network connectivity bandwidth. 
 Introduction to CLDC APIs 
 The CLDC is the base platform on which the MIDP APIs are stacked. The CLDC classes 
 consist of a standardized set of functionality that all vendors who offer J2ME-certified 
 phones will support. Generally, you won't have to interact directly with those 
 classes, but certain devices require that you access those lower-level classes 
 to perform certain functionality. Those low-level accesses will likely be deprecated 
 as the devices and platform develop. 
 Introduction to the MIDP profile 
 The MIDP profile has been developed to support the vertical niche of cell phones 
 or similar devices constrained by screen and keypad limitations, in addition 
 to the obvious battery, processor, and bandwidth constraints. 
 That profile contains a series of APIs that let you create anything from video 
 games using customized graphics to full-scale business applications using external 
 and internal data sources. 
 Several device manufacturers have already announced that they will support 
 the MIDP platform on their devices. At the time of this writing, Nextel has 
 announced that its phones will support MIDP in the first quarter of 2001. 
 Quick example 
 Below is a simple HelloWorld type example that offers a quick overview of a 
 midlet's life cycle. A midlet is the name given for the code that executes on 
 your mobile device. It is similar to an applet in that it contains user interface, 
 data, and control capabilities. 
 import javax.microedition.midlet.*; 
 import javax.microedition.lcdui.*; 
 
 public class HelloMidlet extends MIDlet implements CommandListener 
 { 
 // Initialize the Midlet Display variable 
 private Display midletDisplay; 
 
 // Initialize a variable for the doneCommand 
 private Command doneCommand; 
 
 public HelloMidlet() 
 { 
 // Retrieve the display from the static 
 display object 
 midletDisplay = Display.getDisplay(this); 
 
 
 // Initialize the doneCommand 
 
 doneCommand = new Command("DONE", Command.SCREEN, 
 1); 
 } 
 
 /** 
 * Create the Hello Midlet World TextBox and associate 
 
 * the exit command and listener. 
 */ 
 public void startApp() 
 { 
 // Create the TextBox containing 
 the "Hello Midlet World!!" message 
 TextBox textBox = new TextBox("Hello 
 Midlet", "Hello Midlet World!!", 256, 0); 
 
 // Add the done Command to the 
 TextBox 
 textBox.addCommand(doneCommand); 
 
 
 // Set the command listener 
 for the textbox to the current midlet 
 textBox.setCommandListener( 
 (CommandListener) this); 
 
 // Set the current display of 
 the midlet to the textBox screen 
 midletDisplay.setCurrent(textBox); 
 
 } 
 
 /** 
 * PauseApp is used to suspend background activities 
 and release 
 * resources on the device when the midlet is not 
 active. 
 */ 
 public void pauseApp() 
 { 
 } 
 
 /** 
 * DestroyApp is used to stop background activities 
 and release 
 * resources on the device when the midlet is at 
 the end of its 
 * life cycle. 
 */ 
 public void destroyApp(boolean unconditional) 
 { 
 } 
 
 /* 
 * The commandAction method is implemented by this 
 midlet to 
 * satisfy the CommandListener interface and handle 
 the done action. 
 */ 
 public void commandAction(Command command, Displayable 
 screen) 
 { 
 // If the command is the doneCommand 
 if (command == doneCommand) 
 { 
 // Call 
 the destroyApp method 
 destroyApp(false); 
 
 
 // Notify 
 the midlet platform that the midlet has completed 
 notifyDestroyed(); 
 
 } 
 } 
 } 
 
 This midlet's output is shown in Figure 1, which is a screen capture of the 
 J2ME Windows Toolkit DefaultGrayPhone emulator. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 1. HelloMidlet output 
 
 
 
 
 The first two lines import midlet-specific classes to support the MIDlet 
 class, the CommandAction interface, and the user interface (UI) 
 classes. Those classes are present in the MIDP APIs along with a modified subset 
 of the Java programming language. The classes included in the MIDP API will 
 be discussed in more detail later in this article. 
 public class HelloMidlet extends MIDlet implements CommandListener 
 
 
 This line declares the HelloMidlet class to extend the MIDlet 
 class and implement the CommandListener interface. Each midlet 
 must extend the abstract MIDlet class, which contains three methods, 
 described below, that each midlet must override to complete its life cycle. 
 
 
 Method Name
 Method Purpose
 
 
 startApp 
 To allocate desired system resources and initialize the application. 
 
 
 pauseApp 
 To temporarily suspend resource-intensive processes. 
 
 
 destroyApp 
 To release resources used by the midlet and dispose of the midlet. 
 
 In the previous example, the startApp contains the bulk of the 
 functionality because the HelloMidlet does not use other system 
 resources such as network connections or datastores. When the HelloMidlet 
 is executed, the startApp will be called. 
 As you would expect, the constructor is executed prior to the startApp 
 method. In this example, the constructor retrieves the display from the global 
 Display object. In addition, the constructor initializes the doneCommand. 
 The startApp method above is used to create the screen to be 
 displayed on the midlet. The following line shows the initialization of the 
 TextBox screen. 
 TextBox textBox = new TextBox("Hello Midlet", "Hello Midlet World!!", 
 256, 0); 
 
 A midlet Screen may also contain Commands. A command 
 is the mechanism the midlet uses to create menus as shown in the picture above 
 with the "Done" button. Here's the code used to add the "Done" button to the 
 TextBox screen: 
 // Add the done Command to the 
 TextBox 
 textBox.addCommand(doneCommand); 
 
 The Command source will generate CommandActions 
 when it is clicked. In this simple example, the HelloMidlet will 
 implement the CommandListener interface and thereby handle all 
 events itself. As the developed system becomes more complex, handling events 
 in a more expanded manner may be beneficial. 
 // Set the command 
 listener for the textbox to the current midlet 
 textBox.setCommandListener( 
 (CommandListener) this); 
 
 Now that the TextBox has been created, it is ready to be displayed 
 on the device screen. In the following line, I am setting the current display 
 to the newly created TextBox: 
 // Set the current display of the 
 midlet to the textBox screen 
 midletDisplay.setCurrent(textBox); 
 
 The HelloWorld midlet is a simple example that uses only a few 
 of the classes contained in the MIDP platform. In the following section, I will 
 explore a subset of the MIDP API. 
Overview of the MIDP/CLDC APIs 
 Due to the limited nature of the devices upon which the MIDP/CLDC APIs will 
 run, some Java functionality has been removed or modified from the specification. 
 The MIDP/CLDC APIs include the following class libraries: 
 
 
 
 
- java.lang.*
 
 
 
- java.io.*
 
 
 
- java.util.*
 
 
 
- javax.microedition.io.*
 
 
 
- javax.microedition.ui.*
 
 
 
- javax.microedition.rms.*
 
 
 
- javax.microedition.midlet.*
 
 
 The java.lang package 
 Included in the above library is a subset of the standard classes contained 
 in the J2SE java.lang package. One notable exception is the Float 
 class. The MIDP does not support floating-point calculations. Here are the included 
 classes: 
 
 
 
 
- Object
 
 
 
- Class
 
 
 
- Runtime
 
 
 
- System
 
 
 
- Thread
 
 
 
- Runnable
 
 
 
- Throwable
 
 
 
- Math
 
 
 
- String
 
 
 
- Boolean
 
 
 
- Short
 
 
 
- Long
 
 
 
- Byte
 
 
 
- Character
 
 
 
- Integer
 
 
 
- StringBuffer
 
 
 The java.io package 
 The java.io package contains methods needed to retrieve information 
 from remote systems. The following classes are included in the CLDC API: 
 
 
 
 
- InputStream
 
 
 
- OutputStream
 
 
 
- Reader
 
 
 
- Writer
 
 
 
- DataInput
 
 
 
- DataOutput
 
 
 
- DataInputStream
 
 
 
- DataOutputStream
 
 
 
- ByteArrayInputStream
 
 
 
- ByteArrayOutputStream
 
 
 
- InputStreamReader
 
 
 
- OutputStreamReader
 
 
 
- PrintStream
 
 
 The java.util package 
 The java.util package contains a small subset of the original 
 util package. It contains only the following classes: 
 
 
 
 
- Calendar
 
 
 
- Date
 
 
 
- TimeZone
 
 
 
- Enumeration
 
 
 
- Vector
 
 
 
- Stack
 
 
 
- Hashtable
 
 
 
- Random
 
 
 The javax.microedition.io package 
 The main object in the javax.microedition.io package is the Connector 
 class. You can cast that class into different connection types, described below, 
 using the connection interface. 
 
 
 Connection Interface
 Purpose of Connection
 
 
 StreamConnection 
 To open a basic connection that reads/writes simple data. 
 
 ContentConnection 
 To open a connection that provides content length, type,
 and encoding information. This interface extends from the
 StreamConnection interface. 
 
 
 HttpConnection 
 To open a connection that provides capabilities to
 interface through HTTP including getting/setting headers
 and HTTP-specific handling. This interface extends
 from the ContentConnectioninterface. 
 The Connector open() method has the following general form: 
 Connector.open(":;"); 
 
 
 The javax.microedition.ui package 
 The javax.microedition.ui package contains the classes that you 
 can use to define your midlet's user interface. The APIs offer two major choices 
 of UI design. 
 The Canvas, used in a following example, is used to construct 
 a custom UI using the Graphics object. Using Canvas, 
 you can design multithreaded video games or nontraditional user interfaces. 
 The Screen object and subclasses, used in the HelloMidlet 
 quick example earlier, are used to construct form-based user interfaces. I will 
 discuss the capabilities of those UI classes in Part 2, or you can obtain them 
 through the Javadoc. 
 The javax.microedition.rms package 
 The javax.microedition.rms package contains the classes needed 
 to implement a temporary storage database on the device. That database is limited 
 in its capabilities to store and retrieve information due to the device's size 
 restrictions. 
 I will explore the database APIs in Part 2 of this series. 
 The javax.microedition.midlet package 
 The javax.microedition.midlet package contains the MIDlet 
 class. The MIDlet class executes the midlet life cycle and provides 
 the getAppProperty(key) method to retrieve information from the 
 application properties set in the jad file. 
 Getting started 
 Having completed the above example and explanation of the MIDP platform's power, 
 I'll step through the process of installing the MIDP environment. In addition, 
 I will explore the process of building and deploying the midlet classes. 
 Installation 
 A newly introduced toolkit from Sun has simplified the development of midlets. 
 The Java 2 Micro Edition Wireless Toolkit (see J2MEWTK) 
 provides a comprehensive toolset for midlet development. 
 Currently, two limitations exist in that toolkit's installation. First, it 
 will only run in the Windows environment. Sun will likely announce Solaris and 
 Linux versions of the toolkit in the near future. Second, the installation directory 
 name must not contain any spaces due to the internal build process used by the 
 tool. 
 After downloading the toolkit, you simply double-click on the application 
 to execute it. Several prompts will let you specify the installation location. 
 The J2MEWTK allows integration with the Forte development environment, also 
 available from Sun. To install the Forte extensions to the toolkit, you select 
 custom installation when prompted to choose between custom and typical. 
 The following directory structure is created in your installation directory. 
 Please note, as mentioned above, that if the directory name includes a space, 
 the preverification process will not run correctly. 
 
 
 Directory
 Purpose
 
 
 {Install}/apps 
 Holds the files related to your individual projects. All source, resources, 
 and configuration files will be contained here. In addition, these directories 
 contain the products of the build process run by the tool. 
 
 
 {Install}/bin 
 Holds the bin files used to preverify and build the application code for 
 the midlet environment. 
 
 
 {Install}/lib/midpapi.zip 
 Contains the classes used for the CLDC and MIDP APIs. 
 
 
 {Install}/docs 
 Contains the API Javadoc files and the MIDP UserGuide pdf file. 
 Starting the KToolbar 
 You can launch the KToolbar either from the command line or from 
 a Start menu item created during the installation process. In either case, the 
 executable is called Ktoolbar.bat. 
 The KToolbar will appear on the screen as shown below in Figure 
 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 2. The KToolbar of the J2ME Wireless 
 Toolkit 
 
 
 
 
 Creating a project 
 Once you've launched the tool, you can create a project for the HelloMidlet 
 that I mentioned earlier. To do that, click on the "New Project..." button shown 
 in Figure 2. A dialog box will appear as shown in Figure 3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 3. New Project dialog box 
 
 
 
 
 This dialog box requests the project name and class name of a midlet that 
 will be contained in this project. Because a project can contain multiple midlets, 
 you can change the midlet name entered in this dialog as needed. 
 To continue with this example, you enter HelloMidlet as both 
 the project name and the midlet class name in the New Project dialog box. Click 
 the Create Project button after entering that information, and Figure 4 will 
 appear to collect the settings for the HelloMidlet project. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 4. Required settings for HelloMidlet 
 project 
 
 
 
 
 The settings shown above in Figure 4 are the default settings based on the 
 project name and the midlet name. The MIDlet-Jar-URL value is defaulted to the 
 project name. You don't need to change any of the options shown in the above 
 figure. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5. Optional attributes for HelloMidlet 
 project 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 5 illustrates the screen in the KToolbar that lets you 
 specify certain attributes for a project. The midlet can retrieve those attributes 
 and use them as part of the application. Therefore, I encourage you to fill 
 in values here rather than hard-code them into the individual applications. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 6. MIDlets for HelloMidlet project 
 
 
 
 
 
 Figure 6 shows a list of all the midlets that are included in the HelloMidlet 
 project. The J2ME Windows Toolkit also lets you modify the order in which these 
 midlets appear in the display when the jar file is running in the emulator. 
 In this case, there is only one midlet so it will appear as MIDlet-1. 
 Building the midlet 
 The J2MEWTK contains a built-in build tool that will perform the build process 
 for your project. To build your project, click on the Build button shown in 
 Figure 2. That toolkit contains an automated build process, but others may not. 
 Therefore, here are the steps of the build process: 
 
 
- Create the classes and tmpclasses directories for build processing
 
- Compile the Java source files into the tmpclasses directory
 
- Preverify the classfiles contained in tmpclasses and output to classes
 
- Jar up the verified classfiles
 
- Jar up the resource files
 
- Create a reminder to update the jar file size in the jad file
 As a result of that build process, a jar file will contain all the preverified 
 classes needed to deploy that application to the device and the project's jad 
 file. 
 The jad file 
 The jad file contains all the information about the midlet, its property names, 
 and its associated properties' values. For the HelloMidlet class 
 used in the example, the jad file is: 
 MIDlet-1: HelloMidlet, HelloMidlet.png, HelloMidlet 
 MIDlet-Jar-Size: 1387 
 MIDlet-Jar-URL: HelloMidlet.jar 
 MIDlet-Name: HelloMidlet 
 MIDlet-Vendor: Sun Microsystems 
 MIDlet-Version: 1.0 
 
 The midlet name, URL, size, and version are among the entries listed. The 
 most interesting entry may be the MIDlet-1 line above. There is 
 only one midlet in this jad file and, therefore, only one line. If there were 
 n midlets, there would be n lines as follows: 
 MIDlet-1: ... 
 MIDlet-2: ... 
 ... 
 MIDlet-n: ... 
 
 Each of the above lines would provide the midlet's name, the midlet's image 
 file, and the name of the class file containing the midlet. 
 Why pre-verify? 
 As mentioned above, the class files are run through the preverification process. 
 That process ensures that the classfiles do not attempt any of the invalid operations 
 described previously. In addition, it is beneficial to perform some steps of 
 the standard virtual machine on a more capable computer rather than leave them 
 to the device's KVM. 
 The KVM, designed to fit within 1 K, has been optimized for processing on 
 the devices, not basic duties that you can outsource through preverification. 
 Running the midlet 
 Running the midlet is also handled via the J2MEWTK. Figure 2 shows the KToolbar 
 with the Run button grayed out. Once a project is loaded, this button will be 
 active. To run the midlet, select the device you intend to test from the following 
 list: 
 
 
- DefaultColorPhone: A color version of the default phone
 
- DefaultGrayPhone: The default phone
 
- MinimumPhone: A very basic emulator
 
- Pager: A two-way pager
 Once you select the device, simply click the Run button to launch the emulator. 
 If you prefer to run the midlet from the command line, execute the following 
 command: 
 java -cp \lib\kvem.jar;\lib\kenv.zip;\lib\lime.jar -Dkvem.home= [-D=] 
 com.sun.kvem.midp.Main -descriptor 
 
 
 For a complete definition of the command syntax, please review section 5.5.2.1 
 of the UserGuide file included in the Sun distribution. 
 Graphical framework example 
 The following example constructs a simple graphical framework to enable you 
 to efficiently develop graphics code within the MIDP environment. 
 A simple graphical example will include the following classes: 
 
 
- GraphicalMidlet: The midlet class handling interactions with 
 the device
 
- GraphicalCanvas: The canvas containing the graphical objects
 
- GraphicalObject: A default graphical object that implements 
 Runnable
 
- MovingTextObject: The default moving text object
 
- VerticalScrollingTextObject: An extension to the default text 
 object
 In that example, the GraphicalMidlet class is responsible for 
 extending the MIDlet class and thereby enforcing the midlet's life 
 cycle. In addition, that class is responsible for implementing the CommandAction 
 interface to handle the single command of Exit when the user is ready to leave 
 the application. 
 The constructor of the GraphicalMidlet class retrieves the display 
 object from the statically accessible Display object. The constructor 
 then instantiates a GraphicalCanvas class for which it will perform 
 as the CommandListener. 
 public GraphicalMidlet() 
 { 
 display 
 = Display.getDisplay(this); 
 
 canvas 
 = new GraphicalCanvas(display); 
 canvas.addCommand(exitCommand); 
 
 canvas.setCommandListener(this); 
 
 } 
 
 In the GraphicalCanvas constructor, a new VerticalScrollingTextObject 
 is created passing the canvas and the message. In this simple framework, no 
 additional information regarding the speed, positioning, or the text message 
 color is included. This expansion is left to the reader as an exercise. 
 public GraphicalCanvas(Display d) 
 { 
 display = d; // save the display 
 
 graphicalObject = 
 new VerticalScrollingTextObject 
 (this, "Hello Midlet World!!"); 
 height = this.getHeight(); 
 width = this.getWidth(); 
 } 
 
 The paint method is used by the GraphicalCanvas 
 to redraw the screen as needed by the application. In this case, the canvas 
 clears the previous entry and then requests that the GraphicalObject 
 paint itself. 
 protected void paint(Graphics g) 
 { 
 g.setColor(255,255,255); 
 
 g.fillRect(0,0,width,height); 
 
 graphicalObject.paint(g); 
 
 } 
 
 
 The start() method is invoked by the GraphicalMidlet 
 to alert the GraphicalCanvas to begin its action. In this example, 
 the canvas class instantiates a new thread containing the Runnable 
 GraphicalObject class. The canvas class then starts the 
 new thread so that it may begin its processing prior to calling the repaint 
 method to initialize the painting of the canvas. 
 You can also expand this example by adding more than one GraphicalObject 
 to the canvas and then executing them simultaneously. I will leave that for 
 you as a simple exercise. 
 void start() 
 { 
 display.setCurrent(this); 
 
 Thread 
 t = new Thread(graphicalObject); 
 t.start(); 
 
 repaint(); 
 
 } 
 
 The GraphicalObject class implements the Runnable 
 interface and can therefore be started by the thread in the GraphicalCanvas 
 class's start() method. This Thread will execute until 
 the stopThread method is called to break out of the loop. 
 public void run() 
 { 
 stopThread 
 = false; 
 
 while 
 (!stopThread) 
 { 
 move(); 
 
 canvas.repaint(); 
 
 
 try{ 
 Thread.sleep(100); 
 }catch(InterruptedException 
 ie){ stopThread = true;} 
 } 
 } 
 
 The GraphicalObject does not know the desired movement and painting 
 of its subclass objects, but it specifies two methods that must be overridden. 
 They are as follows: 
 public abstract void move(); 
 public abstract void paint(Graphics g); 
 
 By overriding the methods above, the MovingTextObject can implement 
 the movement it desires and the painting scheme as well. So, to generate a different 
 object, such as a rotating gear, you would just have to change the paint 
 and move methods. 
 public void paint(Graphics graphics) 
 { 
 graphics.setColor(0,0,0); 
 
 graphics.drawString(stringValue, 
 posX, posY, Graphics.TOP| Graphics.LEFT); 
 } 
 
 public void move() 
 { 
 posX = getX(); 
 posY = getY(); 
 } 
 
 In the move() method above, the methods getX() and 
 getY() are called to return the moving text object's X and Y position. 
 I did that to demonstrate an expansion to the framework. In this case, the expansion 
 is fairly simple, the getX() method returns a constant value, while 
 the getY() method increments the position of the Y value until 
 the bottom of the display is reached. 
 You could add additional movement schemes by subclassing the MovingTextObject. 
 For example, a RandomMovingTextObject class might implement random 
 values for the X and Y location points and return those in the getX 
 and getY methods. I'll leave further expansion to the reader. 
 What's ahead in this series 
 My intent for this first article was to introduce the MIDP concept, demonstrate 
 the life cycle through a simple code example, and illustrate a graphical example 
 similar to the basic applets that most of you have constructed at one point 
 or another. 
 In Part 2 in the series, I will discuss the rudimentary storage system that 
 the MIDP provides on the wireless device. Using form-based examples, I will 
 analyze the APIs that you can use to provide a wireless database. 
 In Part 3, I will detail the APIs used to connect the wireless device to external 
 data sources such as URLs. In addition, a more detailed application will illustrate 
 some concepts that you can follow to make MIDP development more efficient. 
 Conclusion 
 The deployment of Java code to the wireless device is the next logical step 
 in the progression of functionality to that platform. The midlet has the potential 
 to revolutionize the wireless platform by letting developers target mobile users 
 more directly with more functional, easier-to-use applications. When combined 
 with some of the other enhancements in the industry, such as location sensing, 
 the platform appears poised for immediate acceptance. 
 As was mentioned earlier, the MIDP platform will be present on devices beginning 
 in January 2001. Nextel has planned support for the distribution of Java-enabled 
 Motorola phones starting in January 2001. 
 This is an exciting area of development that lets developers enter the wireless 
 space without learning too many new Java APIs. The platform gives the "Write 
 Once, Run Anywhere" concept in Java a whole different meaning.
