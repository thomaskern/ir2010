Soft Launch for the NetNewMusic Portal
Posted by: Jeff Harrington
 
 
 Jeff Harrington writes "Saturday, January 26, 2002, NetNewMusic, previously a web listing for new music resources was launched as a new music portal. Its aim is to provide community and curatorial expertise to the wild wild world of independent non-pop, extreme indy, experimental musics. 
NetNewMusic is administered by noted composer, Jeff Harrington and is enlisting curatorial expertise from the online new music world, including Steve Layton and David Drexler. NetNewMusic is loosely affiliated with the Kalvos and Damien's New Music Bizarre radio show and online music community. 
The web will revolutionize new music distribution, opening up the new music world to a wider and more diverse audience. But this new audience is helpless with the incredible numbers of composers claiming to be "experimental" or featuring pop music as art music. 
By curating the new music listing and only featuring the best, NetNewMusic hopes to open the web to the wide expanse of truly new non-pop/extreme indy musics.
