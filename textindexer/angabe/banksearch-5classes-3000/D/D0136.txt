 Graphics accelerators are beginning to include support for 
 curved surfaces as basic primitives, including N-patches. 
 In this excerpt from the upcoming second edition of Real-Time 
 Rendering, see how N-patches can replace triangles to make 
 low-polygon models more convincing and realistic.

 Profile:
 Danny 
 Pelfrey, Composer
 
 For 
 Award winning composer and multi-instrumentalist Danny 
 Pelfrey, music has been an inspiring journey from 
 his roots in West Virginia to the magnetic world of 
 Hollywood film and television. Games are yet another 
 new adventure: "Composing music for games has provided 
 me with a whole new world for freedom of expression. 
 No restrictions are placed on your imagination,"
