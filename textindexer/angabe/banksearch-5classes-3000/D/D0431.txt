 	Building Applications
	 by Monica Pawlan (Copyright Sun Microsystems Inc)
	
	
	Language: Java/Javascript
	
	
	All programs written in the JavaTM language (Java programs) are built from classes. Because all classes have the same structure and share common elements, all Java programs are very similar. 
This lesson describes the structure and elements of a simple application created from one class. The next lesson (Buidling Applets) covers the same material for applets.

 	Building Applets
	 by Monica Pawlan (Copyright Sun Microsystems Inc)
	
	
	Language: Java/Javascript
	
	
	Like applications, applets are created from classes. However, applets do not have a main method as an entry point, but instead, have several methods to control specific aspects of applet execution. 
This lesson converts an application from Lesson 2 (Building Applications) to an applet and describes the structure and elements of an applet.

	Language: Java/Javascript
	
	
	I have presented a few Javascript examples that I have found very useful while designing professional websites. This tutorial is aimed at those who have good knowledge of Javascript. So the examples are not explained in great detail. Only the important parts are highlighted.There are many ways to implement these examples here. The code presented here is neither the shortest nor the most efficient. But it does work satisfactorily.

	JScript link fading system. This simple effective script adds a great effect to your webpages. You can not only fade the text but you can use the other effect that does a random transition. I've read from the MSDN Library (@ msdn.microsoft.com) and it has extensive information about performance with collections and speeding up your scripts when they use them.
