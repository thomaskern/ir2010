Registering
 
 
 
 
	
	Registration is only required on a per forum basis. Depending on the how the administrator has setup his/her forums some may require you to register in order to post, where
 some may allow you to post anonymously. If anonymous posting is allowed you can do so by simply not entering
 a username and password when prompted.
 Registration is free, and you are not
 required to post your real name. You are required to post
 your actual email address, however it will only be used to email you a new password if you have forgotten yours. You also have the option to hide
 you email address from everyone except the administrator, it option is selected by default but you can allow others to see your email address
 by selecting the 'Allow other users to view my email address' checkbox on the registration form. You can register by clicking
	here
	 
 
 
 
	
	
 Smilies
	 
 
 
 
	
	You've probably seen others use smilies before in email messages or other
 bulletin board posts. Smilies are keyboard characters
 used to convey an emotion, such as a smile
	:)
	or a frown
	:(.
	This bulletin board
 automatically converts certain smilies to a graphical
 representation.
 The following smilies are currently supported:

	Using HTML
	 
	
	
	
	
	You may be able to use HTML in your posts, if your
	administrators and moderators have this option turned on.
	Every time you post a new note, you will be told whether BB Code and/or HTML
	is enabled. If HTML is on, you may use any HTML tags, but please be very
	careful that you proper HTML syntax. If you do not, your moderator or
	administrator may have to edit your post.
	 
	
	
	
	
	Using BB Code
	 
	
	
	
BBCode is a variation on the HTML tags you may already be familiar with. Basically, it allows you to add functionality or style to your message that would normally require HTML. You can use BBCode even if HTML is not enabled for the forum you are using. You may want to use BBCode as opposed to HTML, even if HTML is enabled for your forum, because there is less coding required and it is safer to use (incorrect coding syntax will not lead to as many problems).
URL Hyperlinking 
If BBCode is enabled in a forum, you no longer need to use the [URL] code to create a hyperlink. Simply type the complete URL in either of the following manners and the hyperlink will be created automatically:
- http://www.yourURL.com
- www.yourURL.com
Notice that you can either use the complete http:// address or shorten it to the www domain. If the site does not begin with "www", you must use the complete "http://" address. Also, you may use https and ftp URL prefixes in auto-link mode (when BBCode is ON).
The old [URL] code will still work, as detailed below.
Just encase the link as shown in the following example (BBCode is in red).
[url]www.totalgeek.org[/url]
You can also have true hyperlinks using the [url] code. Just use the following format:
[url=http://www.totalgeek.org]totalgeek.org[/url]
In the examples above, the BBCode automatically generates a hyperlink to the URL that is encased. It will also ensure that the link is opened in a new window when the user clicks on it. Note that the "http://" part of the URL is completely optional. In the second example above, the URL will hypelink the text to whatever URL you provide after the equal sign. Also note that you should NOT use quotation marks inside the URL tag.
 
Email Links 
To add a hyperlinked email address within your message, just encase the email address as shown in the following example (BBCode is in red).
[email]james@totalgeek.org[/email]
In the example above, the BBCode automatically generates a hyperlink to the email address that is encased.
 
Bold and Italics 
You can make italicized text or make text bold by encasing the applicable sections of your text with either the [b] [/b] or [i] [/i] tags.
Hello, [b]James[/b]
Hello, [i]Mary[/i]
 
Bullets/Lists 
You can make bulleted lists or ordered lists (by number or letter).
Unordered, bulleted list:
[list]
[*] This is the first bulleted item.
[*] This is the second bulleted item.
[/list]
This produces:
- This is the first bulleted item.
- This is the second bulleted item.
Note that you must include a closing [/list] when you end each list.
Making ordered lists is just as easy. Just add either [LIST=A] or [LIST=1]. Typing [List=A] will produce a list from A to Z. Using [List=1] will produce numbered lists.
Here's an example:
[list=A]
[*] This is the first bulleted item.
[*] This is the second bulleted item.
[/list]
This produces:
- This is the first bulleted item.
- This is the second bulleted item.
 
Adding Images 
To add a graphic within your message, just encase the URL of the graphic image as shown in the following example (BBCode is in red).
[img]http://www.totalgeek.org/images/tline.gif[/img]
In the example above, the BBCode automatically makes the graphic visible in your message. Note: the "http://" part of the URL is REQUIRED for the [img] code.
 
Quoting Other Messages 
To reference something specific that someone has posted, just cut and paste the applicable verbiage and enclose it as shown below (BBCode is in red).
[QUOTE]Ask not what your country can do for you....
ask what you can do for your country.[/QUOTE]
In the example above, the BBCode automatically blockquotes the text you reference.
 
Code Tag 
Similar to the Quote tage, the Code tag adds some tags to preserve formatting. This useful for displaying programming code, for instance.
[CODE]#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello World!";
[/CODE]
In the example above, the BBCode automatically blockquotes the text you reference and preserves the formatting of the coded text.
 
 
You must not use both HTML and BBCode to do the same function. Also note that the BBCode is not case-sensitive (thus, you could use [URL] or [url]).
Incorrect BBCode Usage:
[url] www.totalgeek.org [/url] - don't put spaces between the bracketed code and the text you are applying the code to.
[email]james@totalgeek.org[email] - the end brackets must include a forward slash ([/email])
	 
 
 
	
	
	Moderators
 
 
 
 
 
	 
	 Moderators control individual
 forums. They can edit, delete, or prune any posts in their forums.
 If you have a question about a particular forum, you should direct
 it to your forum moderator.
 
Admins and forum moderators reserve the right to close or delete any post that does not provide
 a clear and purposefull topic. There are many members who still use
 28.8 and 56k modems that do not have the time to wade through useless
 and senseless topics. 
 
Anyone who posts just to increase their Parnasse.com Forums stats or post topics out of
	 boredom risk having there topics closed, removed and/or membership revoked. 
 
Try to make the topic wording mirror what is inside the thread. Topics like "Check this out!" and
 "~~\\You have to see this!//~~" only attract members to a topic they
 may not want to read.
 
 
 
 
	
	
	Changing Your Profile
 
 
 
 
	
	You may easily change any info stored in your registration profile,
 using the "profile" link located near the top
 of each page. Simply identify yourself by typing your
 username and password, or by logging in, and all of your profile information
 will appear on screen.
	 
 
 
 
	
	
	Customizing Using Preferences
	 
 
 
 
	
	As a registered
 bulletin board user, you may store your username in memory for up to one year at a time.
	By doing this we create a way to keep track of who you are when you visit the forum, therefor you can customize the look of the forum
	by selecting from the themes that the administration has provided. Also, if the administrator allows it you may have the option of
	creating new themes for the fourms. In creating a new theme you will be able to set the colors, fonts and font sizes on the board, however
	at this time only the administrator may change the images for each theme. When a user creates a theme the images from the board's default theme
	will be selected.
	
*NOTE: In order to use themes you MUST have cookies enabled.
	 
 
 
 
	
	Cookies 
 
 
 
	
	This bulletin board uses cookies to store the following information:
 the last time you visited the forums, your username,
 and a unique session ID number when you login. These cookies are stored on your browser.
 If your browser does not support cookies,
 or you have not enabled cookies on your browser, none of
 these time-saving features will work properly. 
	 
 
 
 
	
	Editing Your Posts
 
 
 
 
	
	You may edit your own posts at any time. Just go to the thread where
 the post to be edited is located and you will see an edit
 icon on the line under your message.
 Click on this icon and edit the post. No one else can
 edit your post, except for the forum moderator or the
 bulletin board administrator. Also, for up to 30 mins after you have posted you message the edit post screen will give you the option
	of deleteing that post. After 30 mins however only the moderator and/or administrator can remove the post.
	 
 
 
 
	
	Adding Signatures
	 
 
 
 
	
	You may use a signature on your posts.
 If you click on the profile link at the top of most
 pages, you will be able to edit your profile, including your standard signature. Once you have
 a signature stored, you can choose to include it any post
 you make by checking the "include signature"
 box when you create your post. This bulletin board's
 administrator may elect to turn the signature feature off
 at any time, however. If that is the case, the "include
 signature" option will not appear when you post a
 note, even if you have stored a signature. You may also
 change your signature at any time by changing your
 profile. 
Note: You may use HTML or BB Code if the admin has enabled
 these options.
	 
 
 
 
 
 
	
	
	Attaching Files
	 
 
 
 
	
	For security reasons, you may not attach files to any posts. You may
 cut and paste text into your post, however, or use HTML
 and/or BB Code (if enabled) to provide hyperlinks to
 outside documents. File attachements will be included in a future version of phpBB.
	 
 
 
 
	
	
	Searching For Specific Posts
	 
 
 
 
	
	You may search for specific posts based on a word or words found in the
 posts, a user name, a date, and/or a particular forum(s). Just
 click on the "search" link at the top of most
 pages.
	 
 
 
 
	
	
	Announcements
	 
 
 
 
	
	Announcements have not been implemented, but are planned in a future release.
	However, the administrator can create a forum where only other administrators and moderators can post. This type
	of forum can easly be used as an announcement forum.
	 
 
 
 
	
	
	Lost User Name and/or Password
	 
 
 
 
	
 	In the even that you lose your password you can click on the "Forgotten your password?" link provided in the
	message posting screens next to the password field. This link will take you to a page where you can fill in your username and email address.
	The system will then email a new, randomly generated, password to the email address listed in your profile, assuming you supplied the correct email address.
	 
 
 
 
	
	
	Email Notification
	 
 
 
 
	
	If you create a new topic, you have the option of receiving an email
 notification every time someone posts a reply to your
 topic. Just check the email notification box on the
 "New Topic" forum when you create your new
 topic if you want to use this feature. 
	 
 
 
 
	
	
	Can I search private forums?
	 
 
 
 
	
	Yes, but you cannot read any of the posts unless you have the password to the private forum. 
 
 
 
 
	
	
	What are the ranks for the Parnasse.com Forums?
	 
 
 
 
	
	The Parnasse.com Forums have established
	methods to classify their users by activity through the number of posts.
	
	The current ranks are as follows:
	
	
	
	 Rank Title 
	 Minimum Posts 
	 Maximum Posts 
 Rank Image 
	
	No Ranks in the database 
	
	
	
	The adminstrator also has the option of assigning special ranks to any user they choose. The above table does not list these special ranks.
	
 
 
 
 
	
	
	Why are some post icons 
	
	
	flaming
	
	
	 in the forum view?
	 
 
 
 
	
	Flaming icons signify that there are 15 or more posts in that
 thread. It is a warning to slower connections that the
 thread may take some time to load.
