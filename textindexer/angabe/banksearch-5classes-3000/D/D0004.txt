 This second part of Michael Cymerman's MIDP series will focus on the development 
 of an application using non-graphical user interface components. In addition, 
 he'll explore the conversion and storage of application data to the MIDlet RecordStore. 
 These two concepts are discussed in detail through a simple Stock Portfolio 
 management application constructed specifically for this demonstration. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Part 
 1 of this series was focused on the deployment of the J2MEWTK environment 
 and a rudimentary exploration of the MIDP APIs. This part of the series will 
 focus on the development of an application using the pre-canned user interface 
 components provided in the MIDP API. In addition, I'll explore the conversion 
 and storage of application data to the MIDlet RecordStore. These 
 two concepts will be discussed in detail through a simple Stock Portfolio management 
 application constructed specifically for this article.

 The hierarchy of Displayable objects
 In the examples found in Part 1, I discussed the two major categories of Displayables: 
 Canvas and Screen. 
 Canvas is a type of Displayable in which the developer 
 accepts responsibility for creating the entire user interface. This is an extremely 
 useful interface for creating complex graphical interfaces, such as those used 
 in video games. If you choose this path, the UI is drawn on a Canvas 
 object similar to the AWT Canvas used in applets. 
 Screen is a type of Displayable in which you use 
 predefined components to assemble a user interface. The components are similar 
 to those AWT components used in constructing applets, such as Label 
 and TextField. If you choose this path, you will need to add components 
 to a subclass of the abstract Screen object when necessary to construct 
 your user interface. 
 I will focus on the Screen type of Displayable object 
 in this part of the series, since the Canvas object was sufficiently 
 discussed Part 1. As I mentioned above, the Screen object is an 
 abstract class of Displayable. The subclasses of the Screen 
 class are Alert, Form, List, and TextBox. 
 In this article, I will examine the mechanics of these Displayable 
 objects, including the construction, interaction, and event-handling schemes 
 that enable them to come together to form an application. 
 Detailed example
 The best way to learn how to use some of these screens is through an example. 
 The example used here contains some workflow that demonstrates the following 
 concepts: 
 
 
- Construction with different screen types
 
- Construction with different screen components
 
- Usage of commands from within the javax.microedition.lcdui 
 classes
 
- An implementation of MVC for efficient screen manipulation
 
- Interaction with the javax.microedition.rms data store on the 
 device
 To provide this information, I will use a simple rendition of a brokerage 
 application. In this application, the user can buy a stock or sell a stock that 
 he or she currently owns. Please understand that this process has been highly 
 simplified in order to demonstrate key concepts. 
 In Part 3 of this series, I will expand this application to connect with a 
 ticker service to retrieve accurate pricing for the purchase-using HTTP. 
 ExampleMidlet
 The ExampleMidlet provides the context for this application. It 
 controls the flow and provides access to the device resources as defined in 
 the MIDP specification. 
 public class ExampleMidlet extends MIDlet implements Controller
 
 As shown, the ExampleMidlet implements the Controller 
 interface to manage the screen interactions. The intent of the Controller 
 interface is to provide the services needed by both the view and model classes. 
 Controller interface
 The Controller interface contains methods to access the StockDatabase, 
 which is a simple RMS data store, and to manipulate the Display 
 object associated with the MIDlet. The Controller interface in 
 this example is a simple interface that you can expand to include methods to 
 retrieve properties, make HTTP connections, or whatever your application requirements 
 deem necessary. 
 
 public interface Controller
 {
 public StockDatabase getStockDatabase();
 public Displayable currentScreen();
 public void nextScreen(Displayable display);
 public void lastScreen();
 }
 By implementing the Controller interface, the ExampleMidlet 
 can expose certain methods to the individual screens. You could instead pass 
 the MIDlet as a parameter to the screens, but you probably don't want to interfere 
 with the normal MIDlet lifecycle. 
 Within the ExampleMidlet, the nextScreen() and lastScreen() 
 methods have been used to maintain the information about the currently visible 
 screen. These methods use the java.util.Stack object to maintain 
 the display state. 
 The application will push the currently displayed Displayable 
 object to the Stack prior to displaying the next screen when nextScreen 
 is called. 
 
 
public void nextScreen(Displayable display){
 Displayable currentScreen = this.getDisplay().getCurrent();
 
 if ( currentScreen != null)
 _screenStack.push( currentScreen );
 
 getDisplay().setCurrent( display);
}
 
 The application will pop the previously displayed Displayable 
 object from the Stack and set the display to show that screen. 
 
public void lastScreen()
{
 Displayable display = null;
 
 if ( !_screenStack.empty() )
 display = (Displayable) _screenStack.pop();
 else
 display = new WelcomeScreen( (Controller) this );
 
 getDisplay().setCurrent( display);
}
 
 There are other ways in which you could handle the management of the screens. 
 For example, you could read in a screen from the properties file and use that 
 list to manage the interactions between the display screens. This approach provides 
 the necessary management for this example without suffering through a more complex 
 approach. 
 WelcomeScreen
 The first screen that is visible to the user is the WelcomeScreen. 
 Let's walk through the code for this screen. The WelcomeScreen 
 extends from the javax.microedition.lcdui.List object and implements 
 the CommandListener interface. 
 public class WelcomeScreen extends List implements CommandListener
 
 The constructor is passed a parameter that contains a reference to the Controller 
 as an argument, which will be stored as a private variable for future use. 
 public WelcomeScreen(Controller controller)
 
 Because the WelcomeScreen extends the List object, 
 the superclass must be called for instantiation. The parameters passed are the 
 title of the screen and the type of list. 
 super("Welcome", List.IMPLICIT);
 
 List
 In this case, the list is of type IMPLICIT. The list types that 
 you can use are shown in Table 1. 
 
 Table 1. List types defined
 
 List Type
 Definition
 
 
 IMPLICIT 
 Neither checkboxes nor radio buttons are visible next to each item in 
 a list. Users can select only one item from the list. Similar to an HTML 
 Option list. 
 
 
 EXPLICIT 
 Radio buttons allow users to select only one item from the list. 
 
 
 MULTIPLE 
 Checkboxes allow users to select multiple items from the list. 
 
 Ticker
 The WelcomeScreen also contains a ticker that generates 
 a simple welcome message to the user. To create a ticker, call 
 its constructor with a String object of the message to be scrolled 
 and then call the setTicker() method of the Screen 
 object to add the ticker to the heading. 
 Ticker ticker = 
 new 
 Ticker("Thank you for viewing the Stock Application Example");
 
 this.setTicker( ticker);
 
 
 Using the append() method, you can add each item to the list 
 for display. 
 append("Buy Stock", 
 null);
 append("Sell Stock", null); 
 
 The WelcomeScreen will listen and handle any commands that are 
 initiated when it is displayed. Therefore, it calls the setCommandListener() 
 method with itself as a parameter. 
 this.setCommandListener(this);
 
 CommandListener
 The event-handling infrastructure in the MIDlet architecture, briefly discussed 
 in the WelcomeScreen example, lets you handle events generated 
 from the MIDlet Screen objects. 
 Events are generated on user actions, such as clicking the soft-key menu buttons 
 on a Sreen or selecting items from a List. When these 
 events are generated, the commandAction() method of the objects 
 that have registered interest in the current screen will be executed. 
 For the WelcomeScreen example, the user is presented with a list 
 containing two items: "Buy Stock" and "Select Stock." When the user selects 
 one of the items by using the up/down arrows and then clicking the action button, 
 the commandAction() method will be called. 
 
 
public void commandAction (Command c, Displayable d)
{
 if ( c == List.SELECT_COMMAND)
 {
 List shown = (List) _controller.currentScreen();
 
 switch 
 (shown.getSelectedIndex())
 {
 case 0:
 _controller.nextScreen( 
 new BuyStockScreen( _controller) );
 break;
 case 1:
 default:
 _controller.nextScreen( 
 new SelectStockScreen(_controller) );
 }
 }
}
 
 This commandAction() method demonstrates how to capture the events 
 generated by an IMPLICIT list. The first step involves retrieving 
 the list from the display, which in this example is done through the Controller 
 interface. The selected item can be retrieved from the list to allow the application 
 to perform logical operations to determine the proper course of action. In this 
 case, the next display object will be instantiated and passed to the controller's 
 nextScreen() method. 
 
 BuyStockScreen
 Continuing the example, suppose the user has selected the "Buy Stock" option 
 from the Welcome screen. In this section, I will examine the BuyStockScreen 
 object that would be instantiated in that case. 
 public class BuyStockScreen extends StockScreen implements CommandListener
 
 The BuyStockScreen class extends the StockScreen 
 class, which itself extends the javax.microedition.lcdui.Form class. 
 StockScreen
 The constructor is passed the title of the screen and a reference to the controller 
 object, which is to be stored in a protected variable for use by the child class. 
 The title is passed because the StockScreen object is inherited 
 by the BuyStockScreen, SelectStockScreen, and SellStockScreen 
 classes. 
 
 
public StockScreen(String title, Controller controller)
{
	super(title);
 _controller = controller;
 _stockDB = controller.getStockDatabase();
}
 One item of interest in the constructor is the fact that the StockScreen 
 class is retrieving a reference to the StockDatabase interface 
 for use within the child classes. 
 
 
public void displayScreen(String symbol, int numShares)
{
 _symbolField = new StringItem("Stock Symbol: ", symbol);
 _numSharesField = new StringItem("Num Shares: ", ""+ numShares);
 
 append(_symbolField);
 append(_numSharesField);
 generateButtons();
}
public void displayScreen()
{
 _symbolEntry = new TextField("EnterStock Symbol", 
 "", 6, TextField.ANY);
 _numEntry = new TextField("Enter Num Shares",
 "", 10, TextField.NUMERIC);
 
 append(_symbolEntry);
 append(_numEntry);
 
 generateButtons();
}
There are two different displayScreen() methods to illustrate 
 two different user interface components: StringItem and TextField. 
 StringItem
 A StringItem is a display-only item that contains a label and a 
 corresponding value. In this case, the StringItem is used to display 
 the chosen stock and the number of shares for the sell order. 
 TextField
 A TextField is a UI component that lets the user enter information 
 from the phone keypad to the application. The TextField takes the 
 following parameters: 
 
 
- Label
 
- Initial text
 
- Maximum length
 
- Field constraint
 Table 2 illustrates the different field constraints that may be used by default. 
 
 Table 2. Description of different 
 field constraints
 
 Field Constraint
 Description
 
 
 ANY 
 The user is allowed to enter any text 
 
 
 EMAILADDR 
 The user is allowed to enter an email address 
 
 
 NUMERIC 
 The user is allowed to enter only an integer value 
 
 
 PASSWORD 
 The text entered must be masked so that typed characters are not visible 
 
 
 PHONENUMBER 
 The user is allowed to enter a phone number 
 
 
 URL 
 The user is allowed to enter a URL 
 
 You should note that different implementations of the MIDP specification may 
 have differing behavior. For example, the phone number field may contain additional 
 characters, such as the + sign commonly used in European phone numbers. The 
 application must remain sensitive to these varying implementation details until 
 the specification becomes more standardized. 
 Both of the displayScreen() methods will call the generateButtons() 
 method to create the "Next" and "Back" buttons used on all three of the subclass 
 screens. In this method, each Command object is instantiated and 
 in turn added to the screen using the addCommand() method. 
 public void generateButtons()
 {
 this.nextCommand = new Command("Next", 
 Command.SCREEN, 1);
 this.backCommand = new Command("Back", 
 Command.BACK, 1);
 
 this.addCommand(backCommand);
 this.addCommand(nextCommand);
 }
 }
 
 BuyStockScreen revisited
 I will now return to the BuyStockScreen. Because the superclass 
 has handled all of the initialization, this screen needs only to set up its 
 CommandListener actions. 
 public BuyStockScreen(Controller controller)
 {
 super("Buy Stock", controller);
 
 super.displayScreen();
 
 this.setCommandListener(this);
 }
 
 In the commandAction() method, the first check is to determine 
 if the user has clicked on the "Back" button. If so, the controller is called 
 to display the previous screen retrieved from the Stack. 
 public void commandAction(Command c, Displayable 
 d)
 {
 if ( c == backCommand)
 {
 _controller.lastScreen();
 }
 
 If the user has instead clicked on the "Next" button, the process of buying 
 a stock will begin. In this process, the parameters from the TextField 
 must be retrieved. The buyStock() method of the StockDatabase 
 interface will then be called to add the newly purchased stock to the stock 
 database. If this proceeds without any exceptions, the WelcomeScreen 
 will once again be displayed to the user. 
 else
 {
 // buy 
 the shares
 try
 {
 String 
 symbol = _symbolEntry.getString();
 String 
 shares = _numEntry.getString();
 
 _stockDB.buyStock( 
 symbol, shares, 4);
 
 _controller.nextScreen( 
 new WelcomeScreen( _controller) );
 }
 catch 
 (StockException se)
 {
 this.setTitle("Bad 
 Data");
 
 se.printStackTrace();
 }
 }
 
 StockDatabase
 The StockDatabase interface is used to abstract the functionality 
 of the MIDP storage implementation from the application. Because the UI developer 
 does not need to understand the technical details of the data storage, an abstraction 
 of this level can be helpful. 
 public interface StockDatabase
 {
 public void buyStock(String symbol, String shares, int 
 price) throws StockException;
 public void sellStock(Stock stock, int numShares) throws 
 StockException;
 public Vector getStocks() throws StockException;
 public Stock getStock(String stock) throws StockException;
 }
 
 The StockDatabase interface contains methods to add, retrieve, 
 and remove data from the MIDlet RecordStore. The StockDatabase 
 and corresponding data store will be discussed in further detail following my 
 discussion of the UI components. 
 
 SelectStockScreen
 The SelectStockScreen presents the user with a list of stocks in 
 a personal portfolio as retrieved from the database. The constructor of this 
 object is responsible for initializing the display. Recall from the StockScreen 
 discussion that the StockDatabase reference _stockDB 
 has been retrieved in the superclass constructor. The getStocks() 
 method is called to retrieve a list of the stocks in the user's portfolio. If 
 any are found, a Vector containing those stocks will be returned 
 and passed to the showStockList() method for conversion into a 
 friendly user interface. 
 public SelectStockScreen(Controller controller)
 {
 super("Select Stock", controller);
 
 try
 {
 Vector 
 stocks = _stockDB.getStocks();
 
 Item 
 displayItem = showStockList(stocks);
 
 append(displayItem);
 
 super.generateButtons();
 
 this.setCommandListener( 
 this);
 }
 catch (StockException se)
 {
 append(se.getMessage() 
 );
 }
 }
 
 ChoiceGroup
 The showStockList() method is used to retrieve the Stock 
 objects from the Vector of stocks. It then creates a ChoiceGroup 
 object packed with the list of stocks the user can sell. A ChoiceGroup 
 is an Item that you can add to a Form screen. It resembles 
 a list in capabilities and options, but is not a screen type. On this screen, 
 the EXCLUSIVE option for the list has been used to generate a list 
 of stocks to sell so that the user can choose only one stock at a time. 
 private Item showStockList(Vector stocks)
 {
 Stock currentStock = null;
 
 _stockList = new ChoiceGroup("Choose 
 stock", ChoiceGroup.EXCLUSIVE);
 
 for ( int i = 0; i 0) {
 return RecordComparator.FOLLOWS;
 }
 else {
 return RecordComparator.EQUIVALENT;
 }
 }
 
 RecordFilter
 The RMSStockStore object implements the javax.microedition.rms.RecordFilter 
 interface. This interface requires the implementation of a method called matches(). 
 This method will act as a filter to enable the RecordStore to determine 
 whether a given byte array matches the entity that is being queried in the tables. 
 In this example, the RecordFilter is used to obtain the values 
 of a single stock from the database. So, the matches() method must 
 be used to ensure that only the records that match the stock are shown to be 
 true by this method. 
 A review of the following method demonstrates that the stock is again read 
 from the InputStream using the StockStorage() method. 
 The name of the stock is retrieved from the object using the getSymbol() 
 method. Notice that the return statement itself performs the comparison between 
 the name of the stock and the filter value that is stored as a class variable. 
 
public boolean matches(byte[] candidate)
 throws IllegalArgumentException
{
 // If no filter set, nothing 
 can match it.
 if (this.symbolFilter == null) 
 {
 return 
 false;
 }
 
 ByteArrayInputStream bais = 
 new ByteArrayInputStream(candidate);
 
 DataInputStream inputStream 
 = new DataInputStream(bais);
 
 String name = null;
 
 try {
 
 Stock 
 stock = StockStorage.readStock(inputStream);
 int 
 shares = stock.getNumShares();
 name 
 = stock.getSymbol();
 }
 ...
 return (this.symbolFilter.equals(name));
}
 
 Only records for which this method returns true will appear in the set of 
 results to this lookup. 
 StockDatabase
 The RMSStockStore object implements the StockDatabase 
 interface defined for this example. These methods use the helper methods and 
 the StockStorage object to perform the actions corresponding to 
 their names. 
 The buyStock() method is used to add a stock to the RecordStore. 
 It is called from the BuyStockScreen when a user adds a stock to 
 a portfolio. 
 public void buyStock(String symbol, String 
 shares, int price) throws StockException
 {
 int numShares = 0;
 
 try
 {
 numShares 
 = Integer.parseInt( shares);
 }
 catch( NumberFormatException 
 nfe)
 {
 throw 
 new StockException("Number of shares value is invalid", nfe);
 }
 
 The buyStock() method performs some basic field validation to 
 ensure that the values are present and of the correct format. 
 if ( numShares Resources
