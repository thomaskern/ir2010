:: Dezide JTreeTable
The JTreeTable class is new Swing component that merges a JTree with a 
JTable. Considering that you don't have to write either the tree or the 
table yourself, it might be surprising how tricky it can be to synchronize 
the two components.Now you don't have to waste your time on this, just plug 
in a JTreeTable instead. The JTreeTable acts as a normal Swing component 
and will act as a visual shell around your code ensuring that the tree and 
the table handles events, colors and selections in a conforming way.
