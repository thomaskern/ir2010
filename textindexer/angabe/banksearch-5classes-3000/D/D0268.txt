4) Language Fundamentals 
Objective 1) 
Identify correctly constructed package declarations 
 import statements class declarations (of all forms including inner classes) 
 interface declarations and implementations (for java.lang.Runnable or other 
 interface described in the test) method declarations (including the main method 
 that is used to start execution of a class) variable declarations and identifiers.
Note on this objective 
This is a strangely phrased objective. It seems to be asking you to understand 
 where, how and why you can use import and package statements and where you should 
 place the interface statement and variable statements. The 1.1 objective seemed 
 to make more sense in that they asked you to "distinguish legal and illegal 
 orderings" of various statements. I have a feeling that they did not re-write 
 every question in the bank to match the new objectives so you will get similar 
 questions for the Java2 exam.
The package statement 
The name package implies a collection of classes, somewhat like a library. 
 In use a package is also a little like a directory. If you place a package statement 
 in a file it will only be visible to other classes in the same package. You 
 can place a comment before the package statement but nothing else. You may get 
 exam questions that place an import statement before the package statement
//You can place a comment before the package statement
package MyPack;
public class MyPack{}
The following will cause an error
import java.awt.*;
//Error: Placing an import statement before the package 
//statement will cause a compile time error
package MyPack;
public class MyPack{}
 
 
 
 
If a source file has a package statement it must 
 come before any other statement apart from comments 
 
 
 
The package statement may include the dot notation to indicate a package 
 hierarchy. Thus the following will compile without error
package myprogs.MyPack;
public class MyPack{}
Remember that if you do not place a package statement in a source file it will 
 be considered to have a default package which corresponds to the current directory. 
 This has implications for visibility which is covered in Section 1.2 Declarations 
 and access control. 
The import statement 
Import statements must come after any package statements and 
 before any code. Import statements cannot come within classes, after classes 
 are declared or anywhere else. 
 
 The import statement allows you to use a class directly instead of fully 
 qualifying it with the full package name. An example of this is that the classname 
 java.awt.Button is normally referred to simply as Button, so long 
 as you have put in the statement at the top of the file as follows
import java.awt.*;
Note that using a class statement does not result in a performance overhead 
 or a change in the size of the .class output file. 
Class and inner class declarations 
A file can only contain one outer public class. If you attempt to create 
 a file with more than one public class the compiler will complain with 
 a specific error. A file can contain multiple non public classes, but bear in 
 mind that this will produce separate .class output files for each class. It 
 does not matter where in the file the public class is placed, so long as there 
 is only one of them in the file.
Inner classes were introduced with JDK 1.1. The idea is to allow one class 
 to be defined within another, to be defined within a method and for the creation 
 of anonymous inner classes. This has some interesting affects, particularly 
 on visibility.
 Here is a simple example of an inner class
class Outer{
 class inner{}
}
This results in the generation of class files with the names
Outer.class
Outer$Inner.class
The definition of the inner class is only visible within the context of an 
 existing Outer class. Thus the following will cause a compile time error
 
class Outer{
 class Inner{}
}
class Another{
public void amethod(){
 Inner i = new Inner();
 }
}
So far as the class Another is concerned, the class Inner does not exist. 
 It can only exist in the context of an instance of the class Outer. Thus the 
 following code works fine because there is an instance of this for the 
 outer class at the time of creation of the instance of Inner
class Outer{
 public void mymethod(){
 Inner i = new Inner();
 }
 public class Inner{}
}
But what happens if there is no existence of this for the class Outer. 
 To make sense of the rather odd syntax provided for this try to think of the 
 keyword new as used in the above example as belonging to the current 
 insistence of this.
Thus you could change the line that creates the instance of this to read
 
Inner i = this.new Inner();
Thus if you need to create an instance of Inner from a static 
 method or somewhere else where there is no this object you can use new 
 as a method belonging to the outer class
 
class Outer{
 public class Inner{}
}
class another{
public void amethod(){
 Outer.Inner i = new Outer().new Inner();
 }
}
Despite my glib explanations, I find this syntax unintuitive and forget it 
 five minutes after learning it. It is very likely that you will get a question 
 on this in the exam, so give it extra attention. 
 
 
 
 
You can gain access to an inner class by using the 
 syntax
 Outer.Inner i = new Outer().new Inner(); 
 
 
 
 
One of the benefits of inner classes is that an inner class generally gets 
 access to the fields of its enclosing (or outer) class. Unlike an outer class 
 an inner class may be private or static. The examiners seem to 
 like to ask simple questions that boil down to "can an inner class be 
 static or private". Marking an inner class static 
 has some interesting effects with regards to accessing the fields of the enclosing 
 class. The effect of marking it as static means there is only one instance 
 of any variables, no matter how many instances of the outer class are created. 
 In this situation how could the static inner class know which variables to access 
 of its non static outer class. Of course the answer is that it could not know, 
 and thus an static inner class cannot access instance variables of its 
 enclosing class.
The methods of an static inner class can of course access any static fields 
 of its enclosing class as there will only ever be one instance of any of those 
 fields.
Inner classes declared within methods 
Inner classes can be created within methods. This is something that GUI builders 
 like Borland JBuilder do a great deal of when creating Event handlers.
Here is an example of such automatically generated code
 
buttonControl1.addMouseListener(new java.awt.event.MouseAdapter() {
 public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
 buttonControl1_mouseClicked(e);
 }
 });
Note the keyword new just after the first parenthesis. This indicates 
 that an anonymous inner class is being defined within the method addMouseListener. 
 This class could have been defined normally with a name which might make 
 it easier for a human to read, but as no processing is done with it anywhere 
 else, having a name does not help much.
If you create such code by hand, it is easy to get confused over the number 
 and level of brackets and parentheses. Note how the whole structure ends with 
 a semi colon, as this is actually the end of a method call.
As you might guess an anonymous class cannot have a constructor. Think about 
 it, a constructor is a method with no return value and the same name as the 
 class. Duh! we are talking about classes without names. An anonymous class may 
 extend another class or implement a single interface. This peculiar limit does 
 not seem to be tested in the exam. 
Field visibility for classes defined within a method 
A class defined within a method can only access fields in the enclosing method 
 if they have been defined as final. This is because variables defined within 
 methods normally are considered automatic, ie they only exist whilst 
 the method is executing. Fields defined within a class created within a method 
 may outlive the enclosing method.
 
 
 
 
A class defined within a method can only access final 
 fields of the enclosing method. 
 
 
Because a final variable cannot be changed the JVM can be sure that the value 
 will stay constant even after the outer method has ceased to execute. You are 
 very likely to get questions on this in the exam, including questions that query 
 the status of variables passed as a parameter to the method (yes, they too must 
 be final)
Creating an interface 
Interfaces are the way Java works around the lack of multiple inheritance. 
 Interestingly Visual Basic uses the keyword interface and uses the concept in 
 a manner similar to Java. The interface approach is sometimes known as programming 
 by contract. An interface is used via the keyword "implements". Thus 
 a class can be declared as 
class Malvern implements Hill,Well{
 public 
 }
 
 
 
 
Question 1)
Given the following code
public class FinAc{
 static int l = 4;
 private int k=2;
public static void main(String argv[]){
 FinAc a = new FinAc();
 a.amethod();
 }
 public void amethod(){
 final int i = 99;
 int j = 6;
 class CInMet{
 public void mymethod(int q){
 //Here
 }//end of mymethod
 }//End of CInMet
 CInMet c = new CInMet();
 c.mymethod(i);
 }//End of amthod
}
Which of the following variables are visible on the line marked with the comment 
 //Here?
1) l
 2) k
 3) i
 4) j
 
Question 2) 
Which of the following will compile correctly?
1)
//A Comment
import java.awt.*;
class Base{};
2)
import java.awt.*;
package Spot;
class Base();
3)
//Another comment
package myprogs.MyPack;
public class MyPack{}
4)
class Base{}
import java.awt.*;
public class Tiny{}
 
Question 3) 
Which of the following statements are true?
1) An inner class may be defined as static
 2) An inner class may NOT be define as private
 3) An anonymous class may have only one constructor
 4) An inner class may extend another class
 
Question 4) 
From code that has no current this reference how can you create an instance 
 of an inner class?
1) Outer.Inner i = new Outer().new Inner(); 
 2) Without a this reference an inner class cannot be created
 3) Outer.Inner i = Outer().new new Inner();
 4) Outer i = Outer.new().Inner(); 
Answers
Answer 1)
1) l
 2) k
 3) i
 A class defined within a method can only see final fields from its enclosing 
 method. However it can see the fields in its enclosing class including private 
 fields. The field j was not defined as final.
Answer 2)
1)
//A Comment
import java.awt.*;
class Base{};
3)
//Another comment
package myprogs.MyPack;
public class MyPack{}
Any package statement must be the first item in a file (apart from comments). 
 An import statement must come after any package statement and before any code.
 Answer 3)
1) An inner class may be defined as static
 4) An inner class may extend another class
How could an anonymous class have a constructor? Inner classes may be defined 
 as private.
 Answer 4)
1) Outer.Inner i = new Outer().new Inner();
