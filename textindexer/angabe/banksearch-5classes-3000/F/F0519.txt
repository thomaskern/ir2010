 Smilies 
 
 
 
 
 You've probably seen others use smilies before in email messages or other bulletin 
 board posts. Smilies are keyboard characters used to convey an emotion, such as a smile 
 or a frown 
 . This forum 
 automatically converts certain text to a graphical representation when it is 
 inserted between brackets []. Here are the smilies that are currently 
 supported by VBWM Forums:

 Creating a Hyperlink in your message 
 
 
 
 
You can easily add a hyperlink to your message.
 
All that you need to do is type the URL (http://www.vbwm.com/forums/), and it will automatically be converted to a URL (http://www.vbwm.com/forums/)!
 
 
The trick here is to make sure you prefix your URL with the http://, https:// or file://
 
You can also add a mailto link to your message by typing in your email address.
 
	This Example:
	editor@vbwm.com
	Outputs this:
	editor@vbwm.com.
 
 
 
Another way to add hyperlinks is to use the [url]linkto[/url] tags
	 
 This Example:
 [url]http://www.vbwm.com/forums/[/url] takes you home!
 Outputs This:
 http://www.vbwm.com/forums/ takes you home!
 
	 
 
 
If you use this tag: [url="linkto"]description[/url] you can add a description to the link.
 
 This Example:
 Take me to [url="http://www.vbwm.com/forums/"]VBWM Forums[/url]
 Outputs This:
 Take me to VBWM Forums
 
 
 This Example:
 If you have a question [url="editor@vbwm.com"]Email Me[/url]
 Outputs This:
 If you have a question Email Me

 Cookies 
 
 
 
 
 These Forums use cookies to store the following information: the last time you logged in, your UserName and 
 your Password, if you set it in preferences. These cookies are stored on your hard drive. Cookies are not used 
 to track your movement or perform any function other than to enhance your use of these forums. 
 If you have not enabled cookies in your browser, many of these time-saving features will not work properly. Also, you 
 need to have cookies enabled if you want to enter a private forum or post a topic/reply.
 
 
You may delete all cookies set by these forums in selecting the "logout" button at the top of any page.
 
 
 
 
 Active Topics 
 
 
 
 
 
Active Topics are tracked by cookies. When you click on the "active topics" link, a page is generated listing all topics that have been posted since your last visit to these forums (or approximately 20 minutes).
 
 
 
 
 Editing Your Posts 
 
 
 
 
 You may edit or delete your own posts at any time. Just go to the topic where the 
 post to be edited or deleted is located 
 and you will see a edit or delete icon () 
 on the line that begins "posted on..." Click on this icon to edit or 
 delete the post. No one else can edit your post, except for the forum Moderator 
 or the forum administrator. 
 A note is generated at the bottom of each edited post displaying when and by whom the post was edited.
 
 
 
 
 Attaching Files 
 
 
 
 
 For security reasons, you may 
 not attach files to any posts. However, you may cut and paste text into your post.
 
 
 
 
 Searching For Specific Posts 
 
 
 
 
 You may search for 
 specific posts based on a word or words found in the posts, user name, date, and 
 particular forum(s). Simply click on the "search" link at the top of most pages. 
 
 
 
 
 Editing Your Profile 
 
 
 
 
You may easily change any information stored in your registration profile by using the "profile" link located near the top of each page. Simply identify yourself by typing your UserName and Password and all of your profile information will appear on screen. You may edit any information (except your UserName).
 
 
 
 Signatures 
 
 
 
 
You may attach signatures to the end of your posts when you post either a New Topic or Reply. Your signature is editable by clicking on "profile" at the top of any forum page and entering your UserName and Password.
 
NOTE: HTML can't be used in Signatures.
 
 
 
 Censoring Posts 
 
 
 
 
 The Forum does censor certain words that may be posted; however, this 
 censoring is not an exact science, and is being done based on the words that are being 
 screened, so certain words may be censored out of context. Words that are censored are replaced with asterisks.
 
 
 
 
 Lost User Name and/or Password 
 
 
 
 
 Retrieving your 
 UserName and Password is simple, assuming that email features are turned on for 
 this forum. All of the pages that require you to identify yourself with 
 your UserName and Password carry a "lost Password" link that you can use to have 
 your UserName and Password mailed instantly to your email address of 
 record.
 
 
 
 
 Can I be notified by email when there are new posts ? 
 
 
 	
 	
	Yes, the Subscription feature allows you to subscribe to the entire Board, individual Categories, Forums and/or Topics, depending on what the administrator of this site allows. You will receive an email notifying you of a post that has been made to the Category/Forum/Topic that you have subscribed to.
	There are four levels of subscription:
	
	- Board Wide Subscription
	If you can subscribe to an entire Board, you'll get a notification for any posts made within all the forums inside that board.
	
	- Category Wide Subscription
	You can subscribe to an entire Category, which will notify you if there was any posts made within any topic, within any forum, within that Category.
	
	- Forum Wide Subscription
	If you don't want to subscribe to an entire Category, you can subscribe to a single forum. This will notify you of any posts made within any topic, within that forum.
	- Topic Wide Subscription
	More conveniently, you can subscribe to just an individual topic. You will be notified of any post made within that topic.
	
	Each level of subscription is optional. The administrator can turn On/Off each level of subscription for each Category/Forum/Topic.
	To Subscribe or Unsubscribe from any level of subscription, you can use the "My Subscriptions" link, located near the top of each page to manage your subscriptions. Or you can click on the subscribe/unsubscribe icons ( ) for that Category/Forum/Topic you want to subscribe/unsubscribe to/from.
	
	 
 
 
 What does it mean if a forum has Moderation enabled? 
 
 
 	
 	
	Moderation: This feature allows the Administrator or the Moderator to "Approve", "Hold" or "Delete" a users post before it is shown to the public.
	Approve: Only the administrators or the moderators will be able to approve a post made to a moderated forum. When the post is approved, it will be made viewable to the public.
	Hold: When a user posts a message to a moderated forum, the message is automatically put on hold until a moderator or an administrator approves of the post. No one will be able to view the post while it is put on hold.
 Note: Authors of the post will be able to edit thier post during this mode.
	Delete: If the administrator or moderator chooses this option, the post will be deleted and an email will be sent to the poster of the message, informing them that thier post was not approved. The administrator/moderator will be able to give thier reason for not approving the post in the email.
	
	 
 
 
 What is COPPA 
 
 
 
 
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule apply to individually identifiable
 information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address,
 telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the
 child. The Act and Rule also cover other types of information -- for example, hobbies, interests
 and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms -- when they
 are tied to individually identifiable information. More information can be found
