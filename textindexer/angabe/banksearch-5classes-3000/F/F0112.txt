 How to use Winsock Control in order to build Internet applications
 
 The Winsock control shipped with Visual Basic is the very powerful tool. It allows implementing any Internet network protocol inside of your application. In comparance with any other ActiveX controls the Winsock control takes great deal of job. However the situation will be fully under your control and you won't depend on the mistakes of other control's developers. As soon as you have gotten basic knowledge of network protocols and principles of communications you can make virtually any kind of Internet applications. Just stay with me and I guarantee an attractive journey trying to explain how to program Winsock control and how to use it in order to implement any of the most widely used Internet protocols such as HTTP (WWW), FTP, NNTP (News), SMTP and POP3 (Mail).
 
 Let's show the model of two computer's communication. One of them is the client and another one is the server.
 
 The all required Internet software has installed at the client. The client has abilities to send and receive e-mail messages, browse WWW pages, take participation in news groups and load files from remote servers via FTP protocol. All installed software coexists at the same computer and does affect each other.
 
 The other kind of software set up at the server. This software provides services required by the remote clients. The server can manage several clients and tasks simultaneously. In other words the server is running several server applications (FTP server, WWW server and MAIL server) at the same time.
 
 Due to the Sockets technology such a stable simultaneous work of several Internet applications is available. The socket implementation for MS Windows called Windows Socket or just Winsock. Socket is a program device, which supplies sending and receiving data via the defined TCP/IP port for some specific network application. The application can produce as many sockets as it needs for effective job. But one socket works with one TCP/IP port only.
 
 The client's applications creates socket and assigns to him the random number of TCP/IP port it will work with. But it does not happen at the server machine. The server applications, as a rule, work with the early-defined TCP/IP ports. For example, the number of TCP/IP port for FTP server is 21, and another one for Web server is 80. There is a "global arrangement" for widely used services. It defines the number of ports the clients could send their requests by default.

The client starts the network sessions with server via one of the network protocols. The client creates socket and forces it to connect to the remote server. The socket gets the address of server and the number of port to which it has to connect to. As for Winsock control then you should invoke the Connect method. Look at the example below. It shows how to connect to FTP server.
Winsock1.Connect "ftp.microsoft.com", 21
As you see the method requires 2 parameters. The first one is the name of remote server you are going to connect to. It can be in form of plane name or IP address. The second one is the number of port, which defines the kind of service you wish to get from remote server. The port number 21 is intended to be listening by FTP server. "Listening" means that server application waits for client's requests at port number 21. In case of success connection Winsock control will let you know about it by means of Connect event. Now the connection is established.
The further events depends on network protocol you are going to use
- Server expects your commands (HTTP)
- In accordance with used protocol the server sends required data and breaks connection
- Server sends back to the client welcome message and the code of response (FTP, SMTP, POP3, NNTP). It's waiting for your commands now
- Server sends back to the client message about impossibility to maintain further connection as well as the response's code (FTP, SMTP, POP3, NNTP)
In connection time server sends answer messages and we have to be ready to detect and process these messages. In case of Winsock control it raises DataArrival event. Some code which deals with received data we can place into body of that event.
Dim strData As String
Winsock1.GetData strData
The last string of the code above takes received data out of the buffer and stores it in strData variable. Further you can process those data in the way you wish.
 
 Well. The connection has installed. Even you've gotten your first message from server. Now you are ready to start communication with the server in form of commands and his responses. The sample below shows how to start the communication with Microsoft FTP server.
 
Client: Tries to make connection with ftp.microsoft.com (port 21)
 Server: Accepts connection and sends first response to client
 Server: 220 ftp Microsoft FTP Service (Version 3.0).
 Client: USER anonymous
 Server: 331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
 Client: PASS gdal@comset.net
 Server: 230 Anonymous user logged in.
 Client: CWD developr
 Server: 250 CWD command successful.
 
In order to send the data to the server you should use SendData method. Here is the example of sending first command you have read above:
 
 
 Winsock1.SendData "USER anonymous" & vbCrLf
 
All the required commands, rules and order of entering commands you can find in RFC (request for commants) documents.

 http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc959.html 
 
 
 HTTP 
 2068 
 http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2068.html 
 
 
 
The set of commands and responses is unique for every protocol. However, there are a few basic rules you should follow in time of development of your applications.
 
 
- Commands are case-insensitive
 
- Some commands can expects parameters. You should type the parameter after command follow by the space
 
- The command string must be finished with vbCrLf symbol
 
- The server response is the string and numeric value. Additional text depends on the server software but the numeric code of response is the constant. You should deal with that code exactly. The code of response is the 3-digit number from which the response string begins. You can easily extract it by means of the "Left" function. For example:
 strResponseCode = Left$(strServerResponse, 3).
 
 
A few word about disconnecting. As a rule the client forces the end of the session. It's implemented via special command (QUIT is the most used command). The server sends last answer and closes the connection. The Winsock control will let you know about it by means of Close event. It's not common for all protocols. For example HTTP server will close connection immediately after it has sent required by the client resource.
 
 Last notice about errors. There are two types of errors you can expect while working with Winsock control. The first one is the application protocol's errors. They will happen due to the illegal commands or your mistypes. You can figure it out by means of the number of server's response. The second one is the Windows Socket's errors. The Winsock control will raise the Error event in case of any error of that type. Besides of the error's code you'll get short not always useful description. 
 
 I suggest learning about two practical tasks. We'll make simple applications, which works via Daytime and WhoIs protocols. If you have enough knowledge of Winsock control then I recommend having a look at the Winsock Terminal application. After that you'll learn about more sophisticated protocols.
