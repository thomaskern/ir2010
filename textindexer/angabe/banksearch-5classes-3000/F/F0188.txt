IP*Works! contains simple high-level programmable components and powerful TCP/IP programming tools. All controls have simple, yet powerful, interfaces that shield developers from the complexity of TCP/IP programming while giving them access to a wide spectrum of Winsock features. Corporate developers will find the features they need to quickly enable their applications to participate in a TCP/IP network without steep learning curves. Internet developers will find fast components with small footprints that provide excellent performance over dialup links. IP*Works! runs on top of the industry standard Winsock API and implements standard protocols specified in Internet RFCs.
IP*Works! version 5 is /n software's most ambitious release ever, with scores of new features, 12 new components (SOAP, XML, WebUpload, WebForm, Ping, Traceroute, TFTP, HTMLMailer, etc.), updated documentation, an expanded list of sample applications, and a fresh new look and feel! The new ASP Edition is built entirely with C++ and ATL for blazing performance, and it includes unique new security features allowing for fine-grained administrative control of the capabilities of the included controls. IP*Works! and IP*Works! SSL V5 are now available in 15 editions: ASP, Visual Basic, ActiveX, Scripting, C++, Delphi, C++ Builder, and Java.
IP*Works! Now Available in a .NET Edition -- our Xtras.Net site has all the details here.

	Recommended Companion Products for IP*Works! 
	
 
 NT Service Toolkit from 
 Desaware, Inc.
 
 
As an Internet Protocol toolkit there are three basic types of programs you might use IP*Works! to create:
- A client program like a Browser or Email Client,
- A server program like a Web or Ftp Server, or
- An agent program like an Email Broadcaster or an Auction MonitorThe first two should be easy to understand, but the third may not so we'll explain: An Email Broadcaster might monitor a database for email to send and when found send it, and an auction monitor might check eBay every hour for new items placed for bidding.
Both (2) servers and (3) agents should ideally run unattended so they are great candidates to be a "Service" instead of an "Application." A few of the reasons why: 
- A service can start without a user login; nice for reboots,
- A service does not show on the task bar so is less likely to be disrupted by a user. 
For these reasons and more, NT Service Toolkit can make a great companion product for IP*Works!

	<font size=4><div class=cutline>Product Review:</div></font><BR>
	<font size='-1'><h4>So Many Controls...</h4> The folks at /n software have made their already must-have library even more of a must-have! With 30+ components, IP*Works! gives you even more options for Internet development than ever before. <h4>Name Your Flavor...</h4> With IP*Works! you can develop in just about any programming language. The ActiveX, Visual Basic, C++, Delphi, C++ Builder, Java, and Windows CE editions all contain components that are fully integrated in the respective IDE. IP*Works! ASP Edition is designed and optimized for ASP programming and dynamic web applications. For secure connections, IP*Works! SSL adds SSL and Digital Certificate capabilities to the IP*Works! Internet Toolkit, providing Secure Web Browsing, Secure Client, Secure Server, Secure Mail, Digital Certificate Management Capabilities, and lots more. The new Scripting Edition provides property- and method-driven components for developing in scripting environments. And the new .NET Edition consists of fully-managed .NET components. <h4>New Components</h4> Here's a run down of what's new in IP*Works! version 5.0: <li>The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) component allows two machines to communicate using IP*Works!'s HTTP protocol and an XML-based message format, providing a platform-independent method of exchanging data. <li>XMLp is a SAX-2 specification-compliant XML parser. It parses your XML data and raises events to which you can respond whenever it encounters an error in the XML document. <li>The WebForm and WebUpload components let you send information to a web server without having to use a web browser. WebForm uses the HTTP Post method to post data - similar to what happens when you fill out a form online and click on the submit button. WebUpload allows you to upload files to a web server for storage. <li>The Ping and TraceRoute components help you determine if a particular server is running, displaying a list of servers your traffic takes as it goes from point A to point B. <li>The Trivial FTP (TFTP) control transfers files efficiently - just specify the server, the transfer type (such as upload or download), and filename. Network routers such as Cisco use TFTP to upload updates. <li>The NetClock component requests the current time from one of the atomic clocks and can optionally set your system clock. I keep my computer clocks updated with it. Too bad it can't set my VCR! <li>The RCP control is a file-copying program. For years UNIX users have copied files from one box to another using the Remote Copy Protocol; now Windows users can access this program. <li>Ever wondered who registered that domain name, or if a particular domain name was available? The WhoIs component queries the specified name server and returns information regarding the domain queried. <li>The FileMailer and HTMLMailer components easily send out email with attachments or in HTML format. HTMLMailer works like IP*Works!'s SMTP component, except it sends mail formatted as HTML instead of plain text. <h4>Untangle the Web</h4> IP*Works! has all you need for high-powered, just-plain-awesome Internet development. Grab a copy today and put it to work for you <ul> <li>NEW! IP*Works! .NET Edition:100% managed code <li>Over 30 components for Internet development <li>Royalty-free distribution </ul></font>
