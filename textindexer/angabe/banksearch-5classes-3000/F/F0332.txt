	Product Review:
	If you have been developing software for as long as I have, you have seen your share of report writers. In my younger days I even tried to create my own. And believe me, after you have tried to write your own, you begin to appreciate what makes for a good report writer. You notice the little details that make a product special. ActiveReports 2 is one of those products. Let me share with you some of the major features, and tell you why I have fallen in love with this product. 
ActiveX Designer
 ActiveReports is based on the ActiveX Designer specification! That means it becomes part of your Visual Basic design environment. You can design, develop, and test your reports in VB! You can add controls and OLE objects such as graphs straight into the report - the same controls you have used all along and know how to use. It even has the ability to add watermarks to your pages. So you can have that shaded "DEMO" on your demo versions of reports. You could even place your company logo on your reports so you can impress your boss! 
Preserving Your Legacy
 ActiveReports has the ability to import your existing reports from several popular report writers. This allows you to take those existing reports, regardless of their source, and be up and running from the start. The thought of switching report writers becomes close to painless! 
One Syntax, No Waiting
 I love the fact that I can write all my formulas in Visual Basic. ActiveReports requires no new scripting language or funny formula parameters to learn, because I'm working with VB code. But it doesn't stop there - the objects are exposed through COM for complete control, and things like printing options and sections can all be manipulated through VB code. 
The Ins and Outs
 ActiveReports supports ADO, DAO, RDO, and XML for getting data into your report. It allows you to print your reports, of course, but it also has a client viewer so that you can allow reports to be viewed over the Internet. You can also use the export filters to export to RTF, PDF, Excel, HTML, TIFF, and Delimited Text Files. The TIFF exports are great for faxing, and PDFs are great for generating product catalogs for the Web. 
 The viewer also allows for previewing, cutting, pasting, and text searching, and you have the ability to add custom icons to the viewer. It even has IntelliMouse support! The viewer even comes in two flavors - ActiveX and Java. And by having a Java version, you now have increased the operating systems that can use the viewer. 
 You can also imbed Hyperlinks in your reports, so that you can create a table of contents, link to URLs, or even link to other reports. You can use this to drill down into the raw data for the user. Users like that sort of thing. 
Blink and You'll Miss It!
 Of course, Data Dynamics took speed into account when they designed ActiveReports 2. You can tell that when you use the product. They have gone as far as making the report engine multi-threaded, so that it can generate multiple reports at the same time. 
Deliver Reports Via the Web
 If you have a Web server, report delivery to the Web is a snap with ActiveReports. In one application that I wrote for a warehouse company, we allowed clients to go to our web site and log in. Once we validated their login, we allowed them to see their inventory levels, and I filtered the data so that they could look only at their own data. As a result, the clients thought we had created a custom inventory report just for them! 
Professional Edition: Additional Features for Us Pros!
 As powerful as the Standard edition of ActiveReports is, the Professional edition will knock your socks off! Here's what the Professional edition brings to the table: 
- The end user designer control allows you to host the report designer in a form in your application on a royalty-free basis. This gives you the option of letting your users modify and create reports on their own. Do you know how smart this makes you look? Or better yet, how much you can charge for this "feature" in your program? Just imagine no one calling again to ask if you can change a color or font on a report - sounds like nirvana to me! 
- WebCache services allow you to manage report output on Web servers running Microsoft Internet Informa-tion Servers. Now you can cache your reports to memory to push your reports to web clients! Simply put, ActiveReports has all the features that I look for in a report writer! See what the next generation of VB reporting can do for you - add ActiveReports to your arsenal today. 
- Integrates into VB IDE 
- VB language for functions 
- Small runtime requirements 
- RTF, PDF, Excel, HTML, TIFF and Delimited Text Files output 
- Web viewer 
- Over 400 page printed manual 
- Professional Edition adds end user report creation/modifications (royalty free) and WebCache services
