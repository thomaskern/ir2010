 Simple Mail Sender
 
Download Simple Mail Sender Sample
 Project (sendmail.zip, 4kb)
 
The information below will help you to create application, which offers the ability to send simple e-mail messages. "Simple" means that this message can be send to only one recipient and can contain
 only the plain text.
 
Create new project (Standard Exe). The Form1 will be created by default.
 
Change the Name property of the form to "frmSendMail" and Caption to "Simple Mail sender". Change the BorderStyle
 property value to "1 - Fixed Single" as well.
 
Add MS Winsock Control to the project and place one instance of the control to the form.
 Add another controls and place them on the form as shown below:
 
 
 
Change the Name property of New Message, Send Message &#1080; Close buttons to
 cmdNew, cmdSend &#1080; cmdClose accordingly.
 
 Now open the code editor for frmSendMail and add this code:
Private Sub cmdNew_Click()
 txtRecipient = ""
 txtSubject = ""
 txtMessage = ""
 
 
End Sub
Private Sub cmdClose_Click()
 Unload Me
 
 
End Sub
 
Well, all is set and we are ready to go on to the main topic -
 writing the code for sending a message. 
 
If you have already read the introduction to SMTP protocol you know about some commands
 that you have to use to send e-mail message. This commands must be sent in strict predefine sequence. In order to track the sequence we'll use special variable
 m_State, which stores the current state of SMTP
 session. 
 
 You might think of SMTP session state as of state of waiting for server's reply to one of
 client's command. Therefore, the quantity of such states is equal to the quantity of SMTP commands.
 It is useless way to describe the value of SMTP session state with one
 of VB data types. That is why I suggest creating special data type
 "SMTP_State" by means of enumeration
 of all the required constants with VB keyword - Enum:
Private Enum SMTP_State
 MAIL_CONNECT
 MAIL_HELO
 MAIL_FROM
 MAIL_RCPTTO
 MAIL_DATA
 MAIL_DOT
 MAIL_QUIT
End Enum
 
As you see the quantity of Enum's members is bigger then the quantity
 of required command. The reason you'll get to know soon. And now add
 this enumeration into code of frmSendMail. Define the variable m_State
 as well.
 
Private m_State
 As SMTP_State
 
It's not difficult to guess that main events will happen after the
 pressing of Send Message button. We're going to add such a code into
 Click event.
 
Private Sub cmdSend_Click()
 
 Winsock1.Connect Trim$(txtHost), 25
 m_State = MAIL_CONNECT
 
 
End Sub
It's just two strings of
 code. The first one establishes connection to port number 25 (default
 SMTP port). And the second one makes assigning to m_State variable.
 "Is that all ?" you may ask. Yes. Currently it's all. We begin
 the communication between server and our application while establishing
 the link. We're going to manage this process by means of
 Winsock1_DataArrival events. This event will let us know about the
 server's response. According with the response we'll send the required
 command to the SMTP server. The skeleton of this algorithm looks like
 this:
 
 
Private Sub Winsock1_DataArrival(ByVal bytesTotal As
Long)
 
 Dim strServerResponse As
 String
 
 
 Dim strResponseCode 
 As String
 
 
 
 strResponseCode = Left(strServerResponse, 3)
 
 
 
 If strData = "250" Or _
 strData = "220" Or _
 strData = "354" Then
 
 
 
 Select
Case
 m_State
 Case
MAIL_CONNECT
 Case
MAIL_HELO
 Case
MAIL_FROM
 Case
MAIL_RCPTTO
 Case
MAIL_DATA
 Case
MAIL_DOT
 Case
MAIL_QUIT
 End
Select
 
 Else
 
 MsgBox "SMTP Error:
 " & strServerResponse, _
 
 vbInformation, "SMTP Error"
 
 End If
 
 
 
End Sub
 
The first executing string of code figures out the server's response.
 The next IF/ELSE/ENDIF verifies whether the response is equal to one of
 the predefine values. This three code of response is in use by SMTP
 server while communication with the client. All these responses indicate
 the success of executing the command the server has received. Any other
 response indicates the error, which will be displayed via standard
 dialog MessageBox. This dialog appears any time we receive the response,
 which differs from those three appeared in IF/ELSE/ENDIF block. In case
 of the one of the success response the verified expression will be equal
 to True and the execution skips to Select Case block. Here is the
 complete Winsock1_DataArrival routine with the all required comments.
 
Private Sub Winsock1_DataArrival(ByVal bytesTotal As
Long)
 
 Dim strServerResponse As
 String
 
 
 Dim strResponseCode 
 As String
 
 
 Dim strDataToSend 
 As String
 
 
 '
 
 
 'Retrieve
 data from winsock buffer
 
 
 '
 
 Winsock1.GetData strServerResponse
 
 '
 
 
 Debug.Print strServerResponse
 
 '
 
 
 'Get server response code (first three symbols)
 
 
 '
 
 strResponseCode = Left(strServerResponse, 3)
 
 '
 
 
 'Only these three codes tell us that previous
 
 
 'command accepted successfully and we can go on
 
 
 '
 
 
 If strResponseCode =
 "250" Or _
 strResponseCode = "220" Or _
 strResponseCode = "354" Then
 
 
 
 Select Case m_State
 Case
 MAIL_CONNECT
 
 'Change current state of the session
 
 
 m_State = MAIL_HELO
 
 '
 
 
 'Remove blank spaces
 
 
 strDataToSend = Trim$(txtSender)
 
 '
 
 
 'Retrieve mailbox name from e-mail address
 
 
 strDataToSend = Left$(strDataToSend, _
 
 InStr(1, strDataToSend, _
 
"@") - 1)
 
 'Send HELO command to the server
 
 
 Winsock1.SendData "HELO " & _
 
strDataToSend & vbCrLf
 
 '
 
 
 Debug.Print "HELO
 " & strDataToSend
 
 '
 
 
 Case MAIL_HELO
 
 '
 
 
 'Change current state of the session
 
 
 m_State = MAIL_FROM
 
 '
 
 
 'Send MAIL FROM command to the server
 
 
 Winsock1.SendData "MAIL FROM:" &
_
 
Trim$(txtSender) & vbCrLf

 Debug.Print "MAIL

 '
 
 
 Case MAIL_FROM
 
 '
 
 
 'Change current state of the session
 
 
 m_State = MAIL_RCPTTO
 
 '
 
 
 'Send RCPT TO command to the server
 
 
 Winsock1.SendData "RCPT TO:" &
_
 
Trim$(txtRecipient) & vbCrLf
 
 '
 
 
 Debug.Print "RCPT

 Case MAIL_RCPTTO
 
 '

 '
 
 
 'Change current state of the session
 
 
 m_State = MAIL_DOT
 
 '
 
 
 'So now we are sending a message body

'not with vbCrLf

 For Each varLine In varLines
 
 Winsock1.SendData CStr(varLine) & vbLf
 
 '
 
 
 Debug.Print CStr(varLine)
 
 Next
 
 
 '
 
 
 'Send a dot symbol to inform server
 
 
 'that sending of message completed
 
 
 Winsock1.SendData "." & vbCrLf
 
 '
 
 
 Debug.Print "."
 
 '
 
 
 Case MAIL_DOT
 
 'Change current state of the session
 
 
 m_State = MAIL_QUIT
 
 '
 
 
 'Send QUIT command to the server
 
 
 Winsock1.SendData "QUIT" & vbCrLf

 Debug.Print "QUIT"
 
 Case MAIL_QUIT

 End Select
 
 
 
 Else
 
 
 '
 
 
 'If we are here server replied with
 
 
 'unacceptable response
 code therefore we need
 
 
 'close connection and inform user about problem

 MsgBox "SMTP Error:

 vbInformation, "SMTP Error"

 End If
 
 
 
End Sub
 Please pay attention to the strings of the message we're going to
 send. They don't end with the vbCrLf. We're using vbLf instead. This
 rule applies to the header of the message (Subject) as well. Surely
 there are lots of another headers, which differ from Subject. But we're
 not going to discuss it here. Just remember that each one sends to the
 server ended by vbLf. Avoiding doing that results in server's
 misunderstanding the commands you are sending. The last thing you should
 make is to create the routine, which deals with the Windows Sockets
 errors.
 
Private Sub Winsock1_Error(ByVal Number As
Integer, _
 
Description As
String, _
 
ByVal Scode As
Long, _
 
ByVal Source As
String, _
 
ByVal HelpFile As
String, _
 
ByVal HelpContext As
Long, _
 
CancelDisplay As Boolean)
 MsgBox "Winsock Error number " & Number &
vbCrLf & _
 Description,
vbExclamation, "Winsock Error"
End Sub
