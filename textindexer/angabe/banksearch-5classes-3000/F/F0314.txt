SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol - is the hottest thing in XML development
right now. It has a major role to play in Microsoft's next generation of Visual
Studio, and it is the basis of their ".NET" strategy. If you're
looking to write a bullet-proof SOAP service now, in VB6, then look no further
than Microsoft's SOAP toolkit for VB; but if you really want to understand 
what SOAP is all about, then you need to get under the hood, and start building
your own objects around the SOAP standard. This article aims to get you started.
In the article, we will create a simple SOAP service, and a
client to access that service. The service will be in the form of an Active
Server Page, which I have called soap.asp - it will need to live in the root
directory of your Personal Web Service (by default c:\inetpub\wwwroot\) Our
service will accept and process SOAP requests made by our client - a VB exe,
with a single module, and a start-up Sub Main().
Simple Object Access Protocol: A Step-By-Step Approach
By Syd Egan
s we know, SOAP is a call-response mechanism, which operates in a
client-server paradigm. The client (your application) makes a call to the
server (a web server, somewhere on the internet), passing in parameters; and the
server provides a response. Both call and response are transported in the
form of XML documents. Therefore, to build our own example SOAP system, we need
both a client and a server - a caller and a responder.
The example we will follow is a very simple one: we will build a service that
will calculate the tax due on a sales transaction. In traditional VB terms well
will create a function with the following definition:
Public Function GetSalesTax(ByVal
pSalesTotal As Double) As
Double
 GetSalesTax = pSalesTotal * 0.04
End Function
Crude, but effective (if you live in a state where the sales tax rate is 4%!)
This function defines a method name (GetSalesTax), a parameter (pSalesTotal -
representing the total value of the sale) and a return value (the result of the
function). In more traditional object-oriented terms, we might think of
pSalesTotal as an "IN" parameter, and the GetSalesTax result as an
"OUT" parameter. Quite straightforwardly: sales-total in; sales-tax
out. A SOAP service can be thought of in terms of "IN" and
"OUT" parameters - the client passes "IN" parameters to the
server, and then receives the "OUT" parameters in return. So, in order
to create our SOAP service, we need a server that will listen for requests to
GetSalesTax, accompanied by "IN" parameters, and which will respond
with "OUT" parameters, indicating the correct tax amount. Let's start
with the client - the caller. How do we call the SOAP service to make our
request.
The Client
In traditional VB terms, our request to the GetSalesTax function described
above, would be something such as:
dblSalesTax = GetSalesTax(100)
Returning a value of $4.
If the GetSalesTax function was contained within an external object, such as
an MTS server, then the call would need to reference the server DLL:
Dim objTax As
New CTaxCalc
dblSalesTax = objTax.GetSalesTax(100)
In a SOAP system the call is little different, only the request is formatted
as an XML document, which is passed up to the server. The appropriate document
contains the same details as the MTS call -a method to call, and the parameter
name and value.
 100
In order to ensure that the server can correctly identify and decrypt this
method call, it is wrapped up in a larger document, called a SOAP envelope,
which references the universal name-space of the SOAP envelope standard.
 
 
 
 100
 
 
Finally, to complete our SOAP request document, we will add a name-space
reference to our method call, which points to the object which contains the
method - the equivalent of the object declaration (Dim objTax As New CTaxCalc)
in our MTS method call.
 
 
 
 100
 
 
Now that we have built our SOAP request document, we are ready to send it to
the server. The request is a simple HTTP post - just like posting a web form in
your internet browser. Of course, your internet browser masks all the complexity
of sending a form to a server; and in the longer-term .NET will mask this
process from your VB code too. But for now, we need to do the job ourselves; and
I have been using Microsoft's XML HTTP Request object to give me a helping hand.
(The XMLHTTPRequest is an object within the MSXML class library (MSXML.DLL), and
it comes with IE5.) Assuming that strEnvelope contains the XML document
described above, the request is formatted thus:
 
Dim objHTTP As
 New MSXML.XMLHTTPRequest
 Dim strEnvelope As String
 
 'Set up to post to our localhost server
 objHTTP.open "post", "http://localhost/soap/soap.asp"
 
 'Set a standard SOAP/ XML header for the content-type
 objHTTP.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "text/xml"
 
 'Set a header for the method to be called
 objHTTP.setRequestHeader "SOAPMethodName", _
 "urn:myserver/soap:TaxCalc#GetSalesTax"
 
 'Make the SOAP call
 objHTTP.send strEnvelope
 
 'Get the return value
 strReturn = objHTTP.responseBody
Now that we have sent our request,
we move to the server, to see how we set up a SOAP service to listen and respond
to our calls.
The Server
Our server needs to be configured to accept the HTTP post sent by the client.
It will be noted that we direct the client's post to a URL on our local server -
http://localhost/soap.asp. So our first job is to create this page, to listen
for, and process, SOAP calls to our server. We know that our ASP will receive an
XML document, in the form of an HTTP post, with a method name (GetSalesTax), and
a parameter (SalesTotal). So, to write our basic listener service, all we need
do is deconstruct the body of the request (the SOAP envelope) and pull out the
value of the SalesTotal parameter.
The SOAP envelope posted by the client is contained in the body of the
request, or in ASP terms the Request object; and because it is XML, we can load
it into an instance of Microsoft's XMLDOM in our ASP. Soap.asp begins like this:
Set objReq =
Server.CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM")
objReq.Load Request
Thus objReq contains the SOAP envelope we created on the client, and we can
extract the value of the SalesTotal parameter by running an XSL pattern query,
using the SelectSingleNode method of the XML DOM object :
strQuery = "SOAP:Envelope/SOAP:Body/m:GetSalesTax/SalesTotal" 
varSalesTotal = objReq.SelectSingleNode(strQuery).Text
With the parameter extracted, we
can make our calculation to get the sales-tax:
varSalesTax = varSalesTotal * 0.04
Now we have the return value for sales-tax - the response - ready to
pass back to the client, but as with the request, we need to format this
response correctly, in order to comply with the SOAP standard. The SOAP response
envelope conforms to a format-type identical to the request. The only difference
is that the "IN" parameter (SalesTotal, in our case) is replaced by an
"OUT" parameter - SalesTax, and the method name indicates that the
document is a response:
 
 
 
 4
 
 
We can build up this document, either by string-concatenation, or by creating
a new instance of a DOM, and appending the appropriate nodes.
Back on the client, the response is received, and can be decoded by
extracting the appropriate node from the Envelope document:
 
Dim objReturn As
 New MSXML.DomDocument
 objReturn.LoadXML strReturn
 
strQuery = _
 "SOAP:Envelope/SOAP:Body/m:GetSalesTaxResponse/SalesTax"
 dblTax = objReturn.SelectSingleNode(strQuery).Text
And that's it! A functional, compliant SOAP service in a few easy steps. Of
course, the service that we have provided is far from sophisticated, but that is
to miss the point. In the not-too-distant future, Visual Studio 7 will
completely mask the implementation of SOAP; but I believe that there is value in
understanding the way the engine turns beneath the hood. SOAP itself is a very
simple protocol; and I hope you leave this article with a better understanding
the infrastructure that lies behind SOAP, and the methodology through which
SOAP-based component services are going to be provided in the future.
Appendix 1: VB Client Code
NB - This project contains a single module, with a Sub Main start-up object,
and references the MSXML library. 
The code assumes you are running a local web server (localhost),
and that soap.asp is located in the web root, as described below.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sub Main()
 
 Dim objHTTP As
 New MSXML.XMLHTTPRequest
 Dim strEnvelope As
 String
 Dim strReturn As String
 Dim objReturn As New
 MSXML.DOMDocument
 Dim dblTax As

 Dim strQuery As String
 
 'Create the SOAP Envelope
 strEnvelope = _
 """>"

 "100"
 & _
 ""

 'Set up to post to our local
 server
 objHTTP.open "post", "http://localhost/soap.asp",
 False
 
 'Set a standard SOAP/ XML header

 objHTTP.setRequestHeader "Content-Type",
 "text/xml"
 
 'Set a header for the method to be
 called
 objHTTP.setRequestHeader "SOAPMethodName", _
 "urn:myserver/soap:TaxCalculator#GetSalesTax"
 
 'Make the SOAP call
 objHTTP.send strEnvelope
 
 'Get the return envelope
 strReturn = objHTTP.responseText
 
 'Load the return envelope into a DOM
 objReturn.loadXML strReturn
 
 'Query the return envelope
 strQuery = _
 "SOAP:Envelope/SOAP:Body/m:GetSalesTaxResponse/SalesTax"
 dblTax = objReturn.selectSingleNode(strQuery).Text
 
 Debug.Print dblTax
 
 End Sub
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix 2: ASP Server Code
This code resides in an ASP - Soap.asp, in the root directory of the web
server.
