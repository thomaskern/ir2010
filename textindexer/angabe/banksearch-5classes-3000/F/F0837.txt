	New HowTo: Draw text filled with horizontal lines (4K) Intermediate
	
	 
	
	Use the BeginPath API function to start a path, draw the text, and then use EndPath to finish the path. Use PathToRegion to convert the path into a region and then use SetWindowRgn to restrict a control (e.g. PictureBox) to that region. Now you can draw whatever you want in the PictureBox and it will be clipped to the region.

	September 29 
	
	
	New HowTo: Automatically build Web pages (28K) Advanced
	
	 
	
	This program uses MSXML routines to load XML files containing the information that should be in the Web pages. It look at the type of data in the XML file and loads a corresponding template. The template contains the basic HTML code needed for the page and tokens of the form @@@Title@@@. The program uses Replace to replace the tokens with values pulled from the XML file.

	September 5 
	
	
	New HowTo: Draw a rotated ellipse (3K) Advanced
	
	 
	
	Iterate an angle theta from 0 to 2 * PI radians. For each value of theta, X = wid * Cos(theta) and Y = hgt * Sin(theta) represents a point on the ellipse centered at the origin. Then rotate the ellipse's points.
