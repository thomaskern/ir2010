The socket Winsock API 
 function
 
 
To create a new socket we need to call the
 
 socket function. 
 
Public Declare Function 
 socket _ 
 Lib "ws2_32.dll" (ByVal 
 af As Long, _ 
 
 ByVal s_type 
 As Long, 
 
 ByVal Protocol 
 As Long) As Long
 
The function expects three arguments that define 
 the type of the socket we are going to use. Each argument can accept one 
 of the predefined values (constants) that are defined by the Winsock 
 specification. Those values are already declared in the project, they 
 are the AddressFamily, 
 SocketType and SocketProtocol types (see source 
 code of the project or the 
 previous article).
 
 
 Argument 
 Description 
 Enum Type 
 
 
 
 af 
 Address family specification. 
 AddressFamily 
 
 
 
 s_type 
 Type specification for the new socket. 
 SocketType 
 
 
 
 Protocol 
 Protocol to be used with the socket 
 that is specific to the indicated address family. 
 SocketProtocol 
 
 
 
If no error occurs, the 
 
 socket function
 returns a descriptor referencing the new socket. Otherwise, a 
 value of INVALID_SOCKET is returned, and a specific error code can be 
 retrieved with 
 Err.LastDllError.
 
To get more info on this function take a look at 
 the 
 Winsock API documentation. 
 
Now let's create the 
 vbSocket function that supposed to be a wrapper function for the
 
 socket one from the API. Put this 
 function into the modWinsockAPI module.
 
 
 
 Public Function vbSocket(ByVal AdrFamily As AddressFamily, _
 ByVal SckType As SocketType, _
 ByVal SckProtocol As SocketProtocol) As Long
'***********************************************************************
'Purpose :Creates a new socket
'Returns :The socket handle if successful, otherwise - INVALID_SOCKET
'***********************************************************************
 '
 On Error GoTo vbSocket_Err_Handler
 '
 Dim lngRetValue As Long 'value returned by the socket API function
 '
 'Call the socket Winsock API function
 'in order create a new socket
 lngRetValue = socket(AdrFamily, SckType, SckProtocol)
 '
 'Assign returned value
 vbSocket = lngRetValue
 '
Exit_Label:
 Exit Function
vbSocket_Err_Handler:
 '
 vbSocket = INVALID_SOCKET
 '
End Function
 
 
 
What a big deal! One more function with the same 
 purpose and returned value. Maybe it is unnecessary effort to write this 
 function, but I prefer to use the VB IDE editor's feature such as "List 
 Constants" which does allow to don't keep in mind those constants.
 
 
At the next step let's write code for the 
 cmdCreate button. Open the code editor and type in the following code 
 for the cmdCreate_Click event procedure.
 
 
 
 Private Sub cmdCreate_Click()
'*************************************************************
'Purpose :Creates a new socket. If the socket is created
' successfully, adds an item to the listview control
'*************************************************************
 '
 'Handle of a new socket, the value
 'returned by the vbSocket function
 Dim lngSocket As Long
 '
 'Value retrieved from the cboAddressFamily
 'combobox to pass as the AdrFamily argument
 'to the vbSocket function
 Dim lngAddressFamily As Long
 '
 'Value retrieved from the cboSocketType
 'combobox to pass as the SckType argument
 'to the vbSocket function
 Dim lngSocketType As Long
 '
 'Value retrieved from the cboProtocol
 'combobox to pass as the SckProtocol argument
 'to the vbSocket function
 Dim lngProtocol As Long
 '
 'The listview's item that will be added to the
 'listview control, if a new socket is creaeted
 'successfully
 Dim lvItem As ListItem
 '
 'Get values for arguments to pass to the vbSocket function
 lngAddressFamily = CLng(cboAddressFamily.ItemData(cboAddressFamily.ListIndex))
 lngSocketType = CLng(cboSocketType.ItemData(cboSocketType.ListIndex))
 lngProtocol = CLng(cboProtocol.ItemData(cboProtocol.ListIndex))
 '
 'Call the vbSocket function in order to create a new socket
 lngSocket = modWinsockAPI.vbSocket(lngAddressFamily, lngSocketType, lngProtocol)
 '
 If lngSocket = INVALID_SOCKET Then
 '
 'If the function has returned the INVALID_SOCKET
 'value the socket was not created. Call the
 'ShowErrorMsg subroutine to show the message box
 'with the error description.
 Call ShowErrorMessage(Err.LastDllError)
 '
 Else
 '
 'If a new socket was created successfully, add the
 'listview's item for that socket
 '
 Set lvItem = lvSockets.ListItems.Add(, "S" & CStr(lngSocket), lngSocket, , 1)
 lvItem.SubItems(1) = cboAddressFamily.Text
 lvItem.SubItems(2) = cboSocketType.Text
 lvItem.SubItems(3) = cboProtocol.Text
 '
 End If
 '
End Sub
 
 
 
I hope you have got a clear idea, from the 
 comments, what this code does.
 
 
The closesocket Winsock 
 API function
 
 
The Windows Sockets 
 closesocket 
 function closes an existing socket.
 
Declare Function 
 closesocket Lib "ws2_32.dll" (ByVal 
 s As Long) As Long
 
The function receives an argument - descriptor of 
 the socket to close. If no error occurs, the 
 closesocket function returns zero. Otherwise, a value of
 SOCKET_ERROR is returned, and a specific 
 error code can be retrieved with 
 Err.LastDllError.
 
In order to close any socket created by our sample 
 application the user should select a socket in the listview control then 
 click the cmdCloseSocket button. Below is the code for the 
 cmdCloseSocket_Click event procedure.
 
 
 
 Private Sub cmdCloseSocket_Click()
 '
 'Handle of the socket to close
 Dim lngSocketHandle As Long
 '
 If Not lvSockets.SelectedItem Is Nothing Then
 '
 'Get the socket handle
 lngSocketHandle = CLng(lvSockets.SelectedItem.Text)
 '
 'Call the closesocket Winsock API function
 'in order to close the socket
 Call closesocket(lngSocketHandle)
 '
 'Remove the socket item from the listview control
 lvSockets.ListItems.Remove lvSockets.SelectedItem.Index
 '
 End If
 '
End Sub
 
 
 
An application should always have a matching call to 
 
 closesocket for 
 each successful call to 
 socket to return any socket resources to the 
 system. To be sure that we have closed all the 
 sockets created with our sample application we may write the following 
 code that will check for existence of any unclosed socket and do not 
 allow to exit the program until we'll have closed all the sockets.
 
 
 
 Private Sub Form_QueryUnload(Cancel As Integer, UnloadMode As Integer)
 '
 If lvSockets.ListItems.Count > 0 Then
 '
 MsgBox "Close all the sockets before exit."
 '
 Cancel = 1
 '
 End If
 '
End Sub
 
 
 
Frankly speaking, it is unnecessary to use this 
 code in this sample, because we have the 
 WSACleanup call in the body of 
 the Form_Unload event procedure. From the Winsock documentation: 
 "Sockets that were open when WSACleanup was called are reset and 
 automatically deallocated as if closesocket were called;..."
 
 
Testing the sample application
 
 
At this stage of the tutorial, the Winsock API 
 Test Bench sample application can create and close sockets. Let's make 
 sure that it really can do such things. Press F5 to run the application.
 
To create a connection oriented socket set the 
 following parameters for the socket then click the "Create new socket" 
 button.
 
 
 Combobox control 
 Item 
 
 
 Address family 
 AF_INET 
 
 
 Socket type 
 SOCK_STREAM 
 
 
 Protocol 
 IPPROTO_TCP 
 
 
 
 
As you see, a new connection oriented socket was 
 created. This socket can be used for communication with other computers 
 via the Internet applications protocols such as HTTP, FTP, POP3 and so 
 on.
 
Take some time to experiment with the sample. Try 
 to use different combinations of parameters for sockets. You will see 
 that you can get just several types of sockets because your computer has 
 much less transport protocols' providers than the Winsock service does 
 support. To find out which transport protocols are installed on your 
 system use the 
 
 WSAEnumProtocols Winsock API function (see the
 "Enumerating transport 
 protocols" article).
 
If you have implemented the code for the 
 Form_QueryUnload event procedure, you need to close 
 every socket you have 
 created using the "Close socket" button.
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
So, our sample application can create sockets. But 
 what we do know about that abstract substation called a socket is only 
 the 
 magic number - socket's handle. Oh yes, there are three more parameters 
 in the listview control. Do you remember how we got them? We just copied 
 those values from the combobox controls. Are you sure that the system 
 doesn't cheat you, providing you with just an integer number? :-) Read the 
 next article to find out how to retrieve socket's properties. 
 Particularly we'll learn how to find out which transport protocol is 
 used by a given socket.
