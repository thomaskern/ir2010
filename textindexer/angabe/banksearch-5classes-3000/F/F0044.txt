	Search Tips
	
	Our search engine supports words or phrases, wildcard, boolean searches and words or phrases in close proximity to each other.
	Here are a few examples demonstrating these features:
	
	This example matches the exact phrase "Alex Homer". Remember to place quotes around any exact phrase.
	
	
	 
	
	
	The next example matches any resources that have the phrase "Fort Collins" and the word asp.
	Any kind of boolean search is supported.
	
	
	
	 
	
	The following Wildcard search will return ADO 2.1 or ADO 2.5 or ADO 2.x. Wildcards should be inside quotes.
	
	
	
	 
	
	For large descriptions it is sometimes desirous to search for words or phrases NEAR one another.
	This example searches for the word open that is near the word file.
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	You can also search for all links that match a URL. Enter any portion of the URL.
	
	 
	
	
	
 
	
- 
	Can you notify me when there are new resources that match my searches?
	
You bet! That is the main reason we have the My Favorites section. Read more about the 
	My Favorites section.
	
	
 
	
- 
	How do I add my search to the My Favorites section?
	
	When you perform a search you will notice there is a little red arrow that displays
	next to your search criteria. Pressing this button adds the search to your Favorites area as well as automatically marking
	it to notify you when any new resources come in that match your search. You can always take off this notification feature by
	editing your favorites and taking off the envelope next to the search entry.

	My Profile/Favorites
	
	
- 
	<b>Overview</b>
	<p>
	One of the main advantages of the My Favorites section is to provide a quick way for you to access
	favorite categories, news threads and searches with one click of the mouse.
	<p>
	The second advantage of the My Favorites section is the Notification or Tracking feature. You might have
	noticed the little envolope <img src="/images/sendmail.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="9"> next to some of the default Favorites.
	Any Favorite marked with this envelope means that we will notify you when new resources are added.
	When you add news threads to your favorites area we will notify you instantly whenever there is a reply.
	<p>
	<b>Example:</b> Lets say you see an interesting news post in one of the newsgroups and want to track the replies.
	You can add the news thread to your favorites and we will notify you when someone replies.
	<p>
	All other categories/searches marked with the notify feature will be compiled and emailed either daily or weekly (you can choose).
	You may think of it as your own personalized custom newsletter.
	</li>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<li><a name="favoritesdefault">
	<b>When I first came to the site I noticed there were favorites already added
	to the My Favorites section. Why is this?</b>
	<p>
	The Favorites you saw were a set of default categories and searches that everyone
	is given by default. These categories can easily be modified/deleted by pressing the Edit Profile
	button <img src="/images/editfavorites.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20">.
	</li>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<li><a name="favoritesadd">
	<b>How do I add a category to My Favorites?</b>
	<p>
	When you navigate through the site you will notice there is a little red arrow <img src="/images/addfavorite.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="13"> that displays
	next to the category heirarchy. Pressing this button adds the category to your Favorites area as well as automatically marking
	it to notify you when any new resources come in under that category hierarchy. You can always take off this notification feature by
	editing your favorites <img src="/images/editfavorites.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20"> and taking off the envelope <img src="/images/sendmail.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="9"> next to the category entry.
	<p>
	Example: If you wanted to add the Illinois Jobs category to your Favorites you would first navigate to the section you want then press the red arrow.
	<p>
	<img src="/images/faq/addtofavorites.gif" width=460 height=94>
	</li>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<li><a name="favoritesrename">
	<b>Can I rename the short description that displays in the Favorites section?</b>
	<p>
	Yes. Sometimes the short description that gets added to your Favorites doesn't quite make sence
	for your particular category or search. For this reason you might want to edit the friendly name
	that gets displayed in your Favorites area. To do this just press the Edit Profile button
	<img src="/images/editfavorites.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20"> and make the necessary changes.
	<p>
	<img src="/images/faq/samplefavoriterename.gif" WIDTH="552" HEIGHT="61">
	</li>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<li><a name="favoritesedit">
	<b>How do I edit or delete My Favorites?</b>
	<p>
	First you must press the Edit Profile button <img src="/images/editfavorites.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20">. If you want to 
	delete or remove an existing favorite category or search you just press the <b>remove</b> link.
	<p>
	<img src="/images/faq/samplefavorite.gif" WIDTH="550" HEIGHT="66">
	</li>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<li><a name="favoritesenvelope">
	<b>What does the little envelope <img src="/images/sendmail.gif" border="0" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="9"> mean?</b>
	<p>
	The envelope <img src="/images/sendmail.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="9"> means that we will notify you when 
	new entries are added to a favorite category or search. We will 
	compile these new entries and send them to you either daily or weekly (you can choose). Think of it as your personalized custom newsletter. 
	</li>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<li><a name="favoritesdaily">
	<b>Can you notify me daily instead of weekly?</b><img src="/images/dailydigest.gif" align="right" WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="63">
	<p>
	You bet! A week is a long time to wait to see if there are any new resources that match your Favorites. 
	For this reason we provide the option to be notified on a daily basis. Same newsletter just shorter.
	<p>
	<img src="/images/notifydaily.gif" WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="63"><p>
	Just edit your Profile <img src="/images/editfavorites.gif"> and select Notify me Daily.
	</li>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<li><a name="favoritesnewsletter">
	<b>Will I still receive a custom newsletter if I uncheck all Notify options?</b>
	<p>
	The only time you will receive a custom newsletter is if you have a favorite 
	category or search marked with the Notify option. Furthermore you will only
	be notified if there are new resources in that category or search result.
	</li>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<li><a name="favoritesunsubscribe">
	<b>How do I unsubscribe or remove my profile from Devdex?</b>
	<p>
	If you are sure you want to remove your profile from Devdex just <a href="/removeprofile.asp">click here. If you still want your Profile 
	on Devdex but don't want to receive any email notices from us please see, 
	<i>&quot;Will I still receive a custom newsletter if I uncheck all Notify options?&quot;</i>
	
	
 
	
- 
	<b>Do I have an option between HTML formatted emails and Plain Text?</b>
	<p>
	Yes. If you edit your Favorites you have the option to change the format of emails.

- 
	<b>How do I add to my Guru Portfolio?</b>
	<p>
	If you have published articles, code samples, websites, or any other link then you can include them 
	in your Guru Portfolio. Having a packed portfolio makes you stand out as a <u>REAL</u> Guru :)
	<p>
	First you need to login to Devdex by clicking on the <a href="editfavorites.asp"><img src="/images/editfavorites.gif" border="0">.
	Second you need to determine if your link(s) already exists on Devdex. An easy way of doing this is to search for either the title of the link or your name.
	Once the results come back you should see the option to add the resource to your Portfolio.
	
	If your link does not exist on Devdex then you can Add Your Link and specify that you want it added to your Portfolio. Example:
	 
	
	We also provide all our Gurus the opportunity to publish code samples and articles directly to Devdex.
	Just select this option in the <img src="/images/editfavorites.gif" border="0"> Edit Profile/Favorites area. 
	
	
 
	
- 
	<b>How are the Guru points determined?</b>
	<p>
	Every month our Gurus have a chance of taking part in the Guru Showdown where they could win valuable prizes for earning the most points.
