18.9 How to hook hardware interrupts
Q: How do I register my DJGPP function as a hardware interrupt handler?
A: The optimal setup depends on the interrupt frequency and on the
amount of processing it requires. Therefore, only some basic
considerations and techniques are listed below. What combination of these
is best for your application is up to you to decide.
First, some background. Hardware interrupts can occur when the
processor is either in real mode (like when your program calls some DOS
service) or in protected mode. When your program runs under a DPMI
host, hardware interrupts are caught by the DPMI host and passed to
protected mode first; only if unhandled, they are then reflected to real
mode. Therefore, in DPMI mode you can get away with installing only a
protected-mode handler. However, if the interrupts happen at a high
frequency (say, more than 10 KHz), and if your program spends lots of
time calling real-mode DOS/BIOS functions, then the overhead of the
interrupt reflection from real to protected mode might be too painful,
and you should consider installing a real-mode interrupt handler in
addition to the protected-mode one. Such a real-mode handler will be
called before the interrupt gets to the DPMI host, and handle the
interrupt entirely in real mode, so it must be written in assembly and
located in conventional memory (below the 1MB mark). If you need to
hook an interrupt with both PM and RM handlers, you must hook the PM
interrupt first, then the RM one (because hooking the PM interrupt
modifies the RM one). Also, you should know that some DPMI hosts don't
allow you to hook the RM interrupt (CWSDPMI does), and some call both
handlers, no matter in what mode the interrupt arrived (CWSDPMI will
only call one of them); the only way to be sure is to try.
To install a protected-mode interrupt handler, you do this:
- In general, your handler should be written in assembly to be
bullet-proof. You should lock35 all the
memory (code, data and stack) that could be touched by your handler
during interrupt processing (this is virtually impossible if the handler
is written in C), explicitly issue the `STI' instruction before `IRET',
and perform all the other chores described in the DPMI spec (see DOS Protected Mode Interface Specification). To install an assembly handler, you should do this:
- Call __dpmi_get_protected_mode_interrupt_vector and save the
structure it returns (to restore the previous handler address before your
program exits).
- Lock all the memory your handler touches, the code of the handler
itself, and any function it calls, with a series of calls to
__dpmi_lock_linear_region. Failure to lock memory accessed
during the interrupt handling will cause your program to crash. 
Alternatively, you could set the _CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY bit in
the _crt0_startup_flags variable, like this:
#include 
int _crt0_startup_flags = _CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY;
Another possibility is to disable virtual memory by using CWSDPR0 as
your DPMI server.
- Finally, call __dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector and pass
it a pointer to a __dpmi_paddr structure filled with the value
returned by _my_cs() in the selector field and the address
of your function in the offset32 field. 
- If your handler function is written in C, you should generally call the
_go32_dpmi_XXX functions instead of the bare-bones API wrappers
whose names start with __dpmi_. Specifically:
- Call _go32_dpmi_get_protected_mode_interrupt_vector. This
function puts the selector and offset of the specified interrupt vector
into the pm_selector and pm_offset fields of the structure
pointed to by its second argument. This data should be saved and later
passed to _go32_dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector to
restore the vector on exit.
- Call _go32_dpmi_allocate_iret_wrapper, passing it the address of
your function in the pm_offset field and the value returned by
_my_cs() in the pm_selector field. The pm_offset
field will get replaced with the address of the wrapper function which
is a small assembler function that handles everything an interrupt
handler should do on entry and before exit (and what the code GCC
generates for an ordinary C function doesn't include); the effect is
similar to using the interrupt or _interrupt keyword in
other DOS-based compilers.
- You then call _go32_dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector with
the address of the _go32_dpmi_seginfo structure you got from
_go32_dpmi_allocate_iret_wrapper.
- If you want your handler to chain to the previous handler, call
_go32_dpmi_chain_protected_mode_interrupt_vector. This will set
up a wrapper function which, when called, will call your handler, then
jump to the previous handler after your handler returns. Put the
address of your handler into the pm_offset field and the value of
_my_cs into the pm_selector field of the
_go32_dpmi_seginfo structure and pass a pointer to it to this
function. _go32_dpmi_chain_protected_mode_interrupt_vector
allocates the wrapper internally, and also arranges for the interrupt to
call your handler, so you need not call
_go32_dpmi_allocate_iret_wrapper and
_go32_dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector functions
yourself. Also note that currently,
_go32_dpmi_chain_protected_mode_interrupt_vector doesn't return
to you the address of the wrapper it allocates, so that wrapper cannot
be freed by your program. It will be freed by the DJGPP exit code,
though, so this issue is only of concern to programs that allocate and
free lots of wrappers. 
The problem with writing handlers in C as above is that in practice you
can't lock all of memory the handler itself uses, because there's no
standard way of finding the size of the code of a C function, or the
addresses on the stack used by C code. Thus, this approach is generally
unsuitable for production-quality software and should be used only when
the program is known not to page (i.e., if only the physical memory is
used). You might consider disabling virtual memory to make sure your
program doesn't page. To accomplish this, either set the
_CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY bit in the _crt0_startup_flags
variable, or use CWSDPR0 or PMODE/DJ as your DPMI host. In fact, using
one of these methods is the recommended way of debugging the first
versions of a program that hooks hardware interrupts; only after you are
sure that your basic machinery works should you move to testing it in a
setup when paging might happen.
Additional considerations apply if your interrupt handler is a C++
class member function. First, you need to remember that member
functions expect a hidden extra first parameter--this is important if
you use member functions as callbacks. Second, if the function is
virtual, you will need to lock the class's virtual table. Third, you
need to lock the object itself, not only the method you call on it.
Note that _CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY is only recommended for small
programs that run on a machine where enough physical memory is always
available, because the startup code currently doesn't test if memory is
indeed locked, and if there's not enough physical memory installed to
page in all of the memory your program needs, you can end up with
unlocked or partially unlocked memory, which will crash your program. 
If you want to make sure all memory is locked, use a DPMI server which
disables paging.
Buffers in conventional memory (allocated via the
__dpmi_allocate_dos_memory function and its equivalents)
generally need not be locked, since most DPMI servers lock DOS memory by
default. For safer code, you could try to lock them, and if the call to
__dpmi_lock_linear_region returns a failure indication, it means
that the buffer is already locked.
It is possible to lock only the code and data segments of your program,
but leave everything else unlocked. The following code snippet shows
how:
 #include 
 int _crt0_startup_flags =
 _CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY | _CRT_FLAG_NONMOVE_SBRK;
 int (main (void)
 {
 _crt0_startup_flags &= ~_CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY;
 ...
 }
This locks the .data, .bss, and .text segments of
the program, and its stack, but doesn't lock the heap allocated after
main is called. 
To install a real-mode interrupt handler, you do this:
- Call __dpmi_get_real_mode_interrupt_vector and save the structure
it returns (to restore the previous handler address before your program
exits).
- Allocate some conventional memory with __dpmi_allocate_dos_memory
and put the code of your handler there with the dosmemput function. 
(You could also call one of the functions which allocate a real-mode
call-back, but these will cause a mode switch on every interrupt, which you
want to avoid; otherwise there is no point in installing a real-mode
handler, right?)
- Put the address which __dpmi_allocate_dos_memory returned into a
__dpmi_raddr structure (the lower 4 bits into offset16
field, the rest into segment field), then call
__dpmi_set_real_mode_interrupt_vector.
Note that Windows 9X is reported to call both the RM and PM handlers if
both are installed, at least for some interrupts (CWSDPMI only invokes
one of them). So, if you want to play safe, you will need some kind of
a semaphore variable that the two handlers could use so that only one of
them actually handles the interrupt in any given case.
The DPMI spec says that 3 software interrupts are special, in
that they also get reflected to a protected-mode handler. These
interrupts are: 1Ch (the timer tick interrupt), 23h (Keyboard Break
interrupt), and 24h (Critical Error interrupt). This means that, to
catch these interrupts, you need to install a protected-mode handler
only. Unlike hardware interrupts, it doesn't make sense to install dual
RM and PM handlers for these software interrupts. In particular,
Windows will call both RM and PM handlers if you install both, so you
effectively wind up handling the same interrupt twice.
For examples of installing and using hardware interrupt handlers, see
the sources of the Allegro library, the sample code written by
Bill Currie, the Sound Blaster
interrupt-driven functions, the mkkbd package, and the
libhw library, described under sample DJGPP packages. 
Alaric B. Williams has written a
tutorial on interrupt handling.
The DJGPP User's Guide includes a chapter on hardware interrupts, written by Peter
Marinov, which includes sample code for hooking hardware interrupts.
The file src/libc/go32/dpmiexcp.c in the DJGPP library sources,
djlsrNNN.zip, is one example of the subtleties involved with
installing a real-mode interrupt handler. The handlers themselves are
in the file src/libc/go32/exceptn.S.
