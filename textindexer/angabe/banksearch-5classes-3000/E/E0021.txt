Detailed Description
The namespace in which all of GNE resides in.
The namespace consists of a few global functions, some constants, classes, and the GNE::Console namespace, which holds the console IO functions. 
Typedef Documentation
 
 
 
 
 typedef signed char GNE::gint8
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Typedefs for the variable types that are common to all GNE implementations (as defined in the GNE protocol document).
"u" type variables denote unsigned versions. 
 
Function Documentation
 
 
 
 
 void GNE::checkVersions 
 ( 
 const GNEProtocolVersionNumber & 
 otherGNE, 
 
 
 
 
 std::string 
 otherName, 
 
 
 
 
 guint32 
 otherUser 
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Compares other versions against this library.
This is used internally by GNE to compare versions. It checks the GNE version numbers first, then the game name, then the user versions.
Exceptions: 
Error 
 if the GNE versions did not match. 
WrongGame 
 if the game is of the wrong type. 
UserVersionMismatch 
 if the user versions are different. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 void doTrace 
 ( 
 int 
 level, 
 
 
 
 
 const char * 
 fn, 
 
 
 
 
 int 
 lineno, 
 
 
 
 
 const char * 
 msg, 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A function available in a debug compile that does trace logging to a file.
This function is thread-safe. 
Parameters: 
level 
the "level" of detail for this trace statement, 1 being the most basic and should always be displayed. The higher you go, the more detailed the trace should get. This is so to allow debugging but not totally flood the logfile unless you need to get this detailed.
 These general standards are followed:
 1 - startup, shutdown, and explicit error messages.
 2 - connection, disconnection, and other "normal" operation.
 3 - average level. packet registration, socket registration
 4 - events like onReceive and such, and some reporting.
 5 - very low level -- thread creation, memory allocation. 
fn 
The file name this trace was called from 
lineno 
The line number in the file 
msg 
The message to display to the logfile, in printf style, followed by the data. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 void GNE::enableStats 
 ( 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Enables stats gathering, which is off by default.
When stats is not enabled, the get function's results is undefined. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ConnectionStats GNE::getGlobalStats 
 ( 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gets the global stats.
Very similar to Connection::getStats, but this gets cumulative stats for all sockets, user-created ones and GNE ones too you may not know about. 
 
 
 
 
 
 GNEProtocolVersionNumber GNE::getGNEProtocolVersion 
 ( 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Returns the GNE Protocol version number.
This is different from the library version number. This number is specified by the GNE protocol document on the GNE web site. Versions of this library obtained from CVS might have the build number non-zero. Non-beta public releases of GNE will have a build number of zero and a version and subVersion number strictly defined by the GNE protocol specification. Public alpha or beta releases might have a non-zero build number. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Address GNE::getLocalAddress 
 ( 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use this function to get the address of the default networking device on this system, if possible.
The port in the resulting address will be zero. The returned address is invalid if an error occured. 
 
 
 
 
 
 bool initDebug 
 ( 
 int 
 levelMask, 
 
 
 
 
 const char * 
 fileName = NULL 
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Function to initalize debugging.
This is safe to call before initialization of GNE, but can be called at any time (but not multiple times). No debugging messages will be displayed until this function is called, and it is save to use the debugging macros and doTrace before calling this -- just nothing will be displayed. 
Parameters: 
fileName 
an optional fileName to log to. If you pass NULL for this parameter, then GNE will pick a temp file name that is safe for multiple instances. The filename will be based on time: gneHH'MM'SS.log 
levelMask 
sets just how detailed the trace is, and will display all messages that match this parameter. You should bitwise OR together the levels you want to see. 
Returns: 
false on error 
 
 
 
 
 
 bool GNE::initGNE 
 ( 
 NLenum 
 networkType, 
 
 
 
 
 int(* 
 atexit_ptr)(void(*func)(void)) 
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initalizes GNE and HawkNL.
Call this before using any HawkNL or GNE functions. Pass it the atexit function so shutdown will be called on exit. A call to any other GNE function before this function succeeds is undefined. 
Parameters: 
networkType 
a HawkNL network driver, such as NL_IP or NL_IPX 
Returns: 
true if GNE or HawkNL could not be initalized. 
 
 
 
 
 
 void killDebug 
 ( 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Function to deinitialize debugging.
This will be called automatically on program exit, and the GNE user need not call it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 void GNE::setGameInformation 
 ( 
 std::string 
 gameName, 
 
 
 
 
 guint32 
 version 
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The user's game information.
This information is used during the connection process to check if the versions and games match. This function should only be called once before making any connections.
Parameters: 
gameName 
the name of your game, or any other unique string identifier in ASCII format with a length not exceeding MAX_GAME_NAME_LEN ASCII characters. 
version 
a 4-byte value with the current game version in any format. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 void GNE::shutdownGNE 
 ( 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shutsdown GNE and HawkNL.
This function should be called only after all connections are individually shutdown to properly deinitalize the library. However, this function is acceptable enough to be used on an "emergency" shutdown due to some error -- just don't try to call any other GNE or HawkNL function after calling this.
Note that it is possible that this function may block for a short time (500ms or less), while the event generators shut down. 
 
Variable Documentation
 
 
 
 
 ConnectionEventGenerator * GNE::eGen = NULL
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The global event generator.
The library uses this internally to register and unregister connections. The end-user will not have to use this object under any normal cirumstances. 
 
 
 
 
 
 const std::string GNE::ErrorStrings[]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initial value: {
 "No error.",
 "The remote end did not follow the specifications of the GNE protocol.",
 "The remote end uses an earlier version of the GNE protocol.",
 "The remote end uses a later version of the GNE protocol.",
 "The connecting game names differ.",
 "The user protocol version numbers do not match.",
 "Could not open a network socket.",
 "Could not contact the host due to connection timeout.",
 "The remote end decided to refuse your connection request.",
 "Remote computer suddenly disconnected without warning, or dropped.",
 "The operation was canceled because the SyncConnection is released.",
 "The remote end sent a connection close notice.",
 "Network error when trying to read from connection.",
 "Network error when trying to write to connection.",
 "Unknown packet type encountered or corrupted data received -- possible additional data loss.",
 "Packet type received does not match next packet type expected.",
 "Other GNE (not a low-level network) error.",
 "Low-level HawkNL error:"
} 
 
 
 
 
 
 const NLenum GNE::NO_NET = 128
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Normally you would pass a network type to GNE::init, but passing this value means that no network should be initalized.
This is useful only in the example programs that don't use networking and do not need to initalize everything. 
See also: 
initGNE 
 
 
 
 
 
 const int GNE::UDP_HEADER_SIZE = 28
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The low-level header size of a UDP header, which is used with the HawkNL internet driver that GNE uses.
A number that I always have trouble finding and might be useful in getting stats or calculating actual bandwith. 
 
 
 
 
 
 const std::string GNE::ViolationStrings[]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initial value: {
 "",
 " Client sent an invalid request packet.",
 " Server sent an invalid connection response packet.",
 " Client sent an invalid or corrupted unreliable information packet."
}
