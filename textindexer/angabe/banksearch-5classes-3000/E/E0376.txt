lcc is a retargetable compiler for Standard C. It generates code for the ALPHA, SPARC, MIPS R3000, and Intel x86 and its successors. lcc is available for anonymous ftp
from ftp.cs.princeton.edu in /pub/packages/lcc; the README file gives
the details. Here's what else is available: 
 
- Using ASDL with lcc 4.1.
 
- cdb, a machine-independent debugger.
 
- A updated, 
 complete description of the
 lcc 4.x Code-Generation Interface (PDF 256K).
 
- The lcc 4.1 distribution LOG and README
 files.
 
- A sample chapter from A Retargetable C Compiler (PDF 339K).
 
- User-contributed software is available in /pub/packages/lcc/contrib;
 its README
 lists the contributions and gives instructions for contributors.
 
- lcc 3.6 source code.
 
- A bibliography
 of lcc-related papers and talks.
lcc is described in A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and
Implementation (Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-8053-1670-1). This book is a detailed
tour of the lcc 3.6 source code. The ftp
distribution includes the source code for the complete compiler, the code generators
for all its targets, and the code-generator generator that produced them. See the preface and table of contents for more
details.
The USENET newsgroup comp.compilers.lcc is an
unmoderated newsgroup that serves as a forum for all topics related to the installation,
use, and development of lcc. You can post messages to comp.compilers.lcc using any USENET
newsreader or by visiting http://www.dejanews.com/,
which also includes an archive of recent postings.
