What's Wrong With This Code? Volume #4
Base class destructors
Let's show the output of this program one more time.
base constructor
Foo constructor
derived constructor
Foo constructor
base destructor
If you look at the code for the Foo class, you will notice that the Foo destructor is supposed
print the message "Foo destructor". However, the output listing does not contain the destructor message for Foo.
What's going on? Why doesn't the program print the foo destructor message? It should print two of them because there were
two Foo objects created in the code. Take one more look at the output from the program. Notice that the Derived
destructor is also supposed to print a message, but that message is not shown in the program's output either.
The program never prints the foo destructor message because the foo objects are not being deleted. At first glance, this does not
appear to be correct. One of the Foo objects is a member object of the Derived class. It should be deleted automatically
when the Derived object is destroyed. The other Foo object is a member pointer. The Derived destructor deletes
it, so that Foo object ought to be destroyed as well.
The Foo objects are not being deleted because the Derived object is not being deleted. Well, actually it is being
partially deleted. The Base part of the object is being deleted. We can see this in the output of the program. The Base
destructor prints the message "base destructor". When the
main function calls delete, the Base part of the object is destroyed, but the Derived part of the
object is not.
The code contains a critical design flaw. The destructor in the base class is not declared as virtual. As a result, when the code calls
delete on the Base *, only the destructor for the base class gets called. Because there is no vtable entry for the destructor,
operator delete has no way of knowing that you are really deleting a Derived object. As far as it is concerned, you are deleting
a plain Base object.
To fix the code, declare the base class destructor to be virtual. The following code listing illustrates how to correct the code.
class Base
{
public:
 Base()
 {
 cout "base constructor" endl;
 }
 virtual ~Base()
 {
 cout "base destructor" endl;
 }
};
There is a bit of irony to how we fixed the code. The original problem was that the Foo objects were not being
destroyed, and the destructor for the Derived class was not getting called. So who do we blame? We can't blame the
Derived class, and we certainly can't pin any blame on Foo. It's just an innocent bystander. The culprit
is embedded deep down in the base class.
There is a rule of thumb that should be followed here (in my opinion anyway). Base class destructors should always be declared
virtual. This may not be news to you, especially if you are familiar with Scott Meyer's "Effective C++" series. Some people argue
that you don't always have to make the base class destructor virtual. If you don't delete the object by using a pointer to a base class,
then the problem disappears. For example, if the main function was coded like this, then the Derived destructor would have
been called.
int main()
{
 //Base *b = new Derived;
 Derived *b = new Derived;
 delete b;
 return 0;
}
I think this is a poor argument. As a designer of a base class, how can you be certain how people are going to use your class?
Forcing your users to always use a pointer to a derived object severely limits their ability to use your class. You have effectively
prevented them from using polymorphism, one of the key ingredients of object oriented programming.
To drive home this argument, let's pretend that we have a base class and two classes that derive from it called Derived1 and
Derived2. Both derived classes share some common functionally in the Base class. This common base may consist of
shared code, or the common base could provide only an interface that the derived classes have to support.
class Base
{
 ...
 public:
 virtual void DoSomething();
 ~Base();
};
class Derived1 : public Base
{
 ... // private members
 public:
 virtual void DoSomething();
};
class Derived2 : public Base
{
 ... // private members
 public:
 virtual void DoSomething();
};
Now let's say that you want to store some of these objects in a container. The container should be able to store all three types
of objects. You intend to iterate the container and call the DoSomething method on each object. When you are done, you will
need to loop through the container and delete each object. Here is how you might go about it.
vector base_vector;
base_vector.push_back( new Base);
base_vector.push_back( new Base);
base_vector.push_back( new Derived1);
base_vector.push_back( new Derived2);
vector::iterator iter = base_vector.begin();
for(; iter != base_vector.end(); ++iter)
{
 iter->DoSomething();
}
... more stuff
iter = base_vector.begin();
for(; iter != base_vector.end(); ++iter)
{
 delete *iter;
}
Because the container holds Base pointers, the container takes on a polymorphic form. It can hold Base
objects, or derived objects. It really doesn't care. Because DoSomething is virtual, the correct member function
gets called. But what about the destruction of the objects? Because the Base destructor is not virtual, the derived
destructors will never run. If you design a base class and you don't make the destructor virtual, you are essentially preventing
users of your class from ever putting objects of your class into a container. Ouch!
I have also heard some people argue that if the derived class does not allocate any additional memory by calling operator new,
that there is no need for its destructor to be called. Hence, the base destructor need not be virtual. This is complete hogwash. Look back
at the original code for this article. The Derived class contained two Foo objects. One of them was a pointer, and one
of them was not. Neither of them were destroyed properly. It makes no difference whether or not they are pointers. The reason for this is
clear. When you write the Derived destructor, the compiler silently inserts code to destroy all non-pointer member objects. You can step
through this code in assembler if you want. This code is part of the Derived destructor. If the Derived destructor
is not called, neither is the silent code that cleans up non-pointer objects.
Ok, ok, but what if the Derived object does not contain any member objects? Then its OK not to have a virtual destructor
in the base class, right? Well, maybe. But if you are designing a base class, do you have any right to prevent all derived classes
from having any member variables (other than integral types, such as int). People are not going to want to use your class as a base
if you try to force that rule on them.
There is only one situation where it is acceptable for a base class destructor to not be virtual: the class is a concrete class and it is
should not be derived from. In reality, its not a base class at all. No classes derive from it.
Note : The example code for this article contained a class hierarchy that was only two levels deep. When the hierarchy is more than
two classes deep, the deepest base class should declare a virtual destructor (ie, the one at the top). For example:
class Base
{
 ...
 public:
 virtual ~Base();
};
class Middle : public Base
{
 ...
 public:
 ~Middle();
};
class End : public Middle
{
 ...
 public:
 ~End();
};
Recall that once a function is declared as virtual in a base class, it is considered virtual in all derived classes. This is why the
Middle and End classes do not have to list virtual before their destructors. Some people like to list virtual anyway,
to avoid confusion.
Note : Chris Uzdavinis sent me this note:
I read the new "w3tc" article, on virtual destructors in the base class of
polymorphic hierarchies. You explain it well, but I think that your warning
is too soft. :) The ANSI standard says that if you call delete on a pointer
that points to a derived type, then the destructor SHALL be virtual or
behavior is undefined. You cannot even count on the base part being deleted
correctly.
See Ansi 5.3.5 p3 for details.

Note : If you do not provide a destructor for your base class, the compiler will generate a default one for you.
This default destructor is not virtual. Omitting a destructor in the base class is equivalent to adding a non-virtual destructor.
In order to follow the advice in this article, you may have to add empty, virtual destructors to your base classes. In fact,
this is how many people fall victim to this problem. They forget to provide a destructor in a base class that does not contain
any members.
Note : This is also a problem in Object Pascal and Delphi. Well sort of. The same problem exists, but Borland's version of
Object Pascal essentially squashes it before it has a chance to surface. In Object Pascal, all classes are derived from TObject.
It does not matter whether you list TObject as a base class or not. The TObject class contains a virtual
destructor, which prevents the problem from surfacing. If Borland ever changes Delphi so that classes are not automatically derived from
TObject, then the problem would become more serious for Object Pascal programmers.
Note : If you are thinking of deriving from a class that someone else wrote, check to make sure that it has a virtual
destructor. If it does not, then you can't derive from it. The STL classes fall into this category. Their destructors are
not virtual, so you may not want to derive from them.
Note : Scott Meyers discusses the importance of making base class destructors virtual in his book
"Effective C++".
He discusses something in his book that I thought was worth mentioning here. While it is important to make the destructor
of a base class virtual, it is equally important that you don't overdo it. If a class will not and should not be used as a
base class, then do not make the destructor virtual. In fact, if the class is not a suitable base class, then it should not
contain any virtual methods.
Meyers gives some good examples of classes that should not have a virtual destructor. One example was a point class, similar to the
TPoint class in C++Builder. TPoint represents an x-y point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The declaration
for TPoint is in windows.hpp
struct TPoint
{
 TPoint() {}
 TPoint(int _x, int _y) : x(_x), y(_y) {}
 TPoint(POINT& pt)
 {
 x = pt.x;
 y = pt.y;
 }
// ...
 int x;
 int y;
};
This version of TPoint contains two integer member variables. Since the structure does not contain any virtual functions, the
class won't have a vtable. The absence of a vtable means that the total size of a TPoint object will equal 8 bytes, 4 bytes
for each integer member variable. If we add a virtual destructor to TPoint, then the size of the class grows by four bytes,
making the total size 12. In addition to the extra four bytes, the code size of the class also grows because the compiler has to insert
extra code to initialize and cleanup the vtable.
The extra four bytes for the vtable pointer is uneeded bloat if the class does not serve as a base class. In "Effective C++", Meyers
advice is simple: if a class serves as a base class, then it should have a virtual destructor. If a class functions as a stand alone,
concrete class, such as TPoint, then it should not have virtual destructor. Furthermore, if someone gives you class that
does not have a virtual destructor, then it means that either the class should not be derived from, or that person has not read "Effective
C++". Either way, you probably should not derive from that class. (PS- If you don't already own a copy of
"Effective C++", you should buy one. This
book is well worth the money).
