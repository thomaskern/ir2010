Yet Another Code Site
	 
	
	
	
	
 
This site is dedicated to advancing the
	understanding of Borland's C++ Builder, the Borland Visual
	Component Library (VCL), and related Microsoft Windows API
	issues.
	
In particular, I have spent an inexcusable amount of time
	working through many of the problems associated with Rich Edit
	controls. Here you will find information on using OLE with
	Rich Edit controls, using the relatively unknown Rich Edit
	version 2.0, using the even newer Rich Edit version 3.0, answers
	to frequently asked questions about Rich Edit controls, and other
	information that I hope you will find useful.
	
To save others a little effort, I have made most of the code
	that I use available for downloading. Unless otherwise
	stated, you may use it freely with the following limitation: 
	You may not distribute the code to others. Please send them
	here if they are interested. If you find the code useful, a
	little credit would be appreciated, but is not required.

	The TAE TraceToolKit Is Now Available (October 17, 2000)
The
	most frustrating part of being a developer is not getting useful
	debugging information from users. With this small toolkit,
	you can get detailed trace information from your users. See
	the Code Samples section
	for new code.
	
TaeRichEdit
	Component users: I am adding trace support to the
	TaeRichEdit Component. You will be able to disable the
	trace support for release builds, of course. (Actually, you will
	be able to disable the trace support in debug builds as well.)

	Interim Bug Fixes for the TaeRichEdit Component Available
	(September 9, 2000)
Interim bug fixes for the TaeRichEdit
	Component are now available which address GPF problems with
	certain printers, improve STL compatibility, and correct certain
	problems not previously reported. The changes are not yet
	fully incorporated into the component beta distribution code but
	are supplied as replacements for *.cpp & *.h files in the
	1.0.0.9 distribution. See the TaeRichEdit
	Component section for more information.
 
	 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
	New Code: Regular Expression Searches
After some
	lengthy effort, I have developed a light-weight class to
	implement regular expression searches for TRichEdit components. 
	See the Code Samples
	section for the TTaeRegExp class. If you do not know what
	"regular expressions" are, check out the Regular
	Expression Syntax.page. (Note: This code "upgrades"
	the BCB/VCL from PCRE 2.x to PCRE 3.4.)
 
	 
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	
Open Source Efforts Links
Thanks to site visitors, I
	recently became aware of open source efforts that may interest
	you. Some of these include near replacements for Rich Edit
	controls, RTF compatible editors, syntax-highlighting editors,
	and sites with links to other open source endeavors. See
	the new Open Source

TaeRichEdit Component
	 
	
	
	
	
The TaeRichEdit Component is a full-featured TRichEdit
	analogue. It supports Rich Edit 2.0 & 3.0 character and
	paragraph formatting; provides OLE support (including embedded
	graphics); expands printing options to include headers, footers,
	and border lines; and much more. The Borland C++ Builder
	(no Delphi) source is included. The component is free for
	non-commercial use.

	A set of interim fixes for version 1.0.0.9 is now available.

Rich Edit 3.0 Code Samples
Rich Edit 3.0 is now
	freely available to developers. If you have it, here is the
	code you need to get started (a really basic class to get v3.0
	loaded) and code samples to demonstrate the new features that I
	have tested (paragraph numbering, zoom in/out, saving/restoring
	the scroll position, etc.), MSDN documentation errors that I have
	overcome, and unexpected limitations that I have encountered. 
	This page will definitely be changing frequently for a while, so
	check back often.
Go
	to the Rich Edit 3.0 Code Samples page. Last

MEd &#150; A Rich
	Edit 2.0 Sample
MEd is the project for which most of the
	code on this site was developed. 
	The program executable is posted here as an example of what can
	be done with the Rich Edit 2.0 control. 
	If you find code on this site that does not work as expected, as
	a favor to me, try this executable to determine if the
	sample code is munged or if my "best effort" does not
	solve the problem.

	Rich Edit 2.0 with BCB for more information. 
	(Note: This class optionally uses the TRichEditOle &
	TRichEditOleCallback classes above.) This download also
	contains classes that extend the TTextAttributes and
	TParaAttributes classes to provide support for the WinAPI
	CHARFORMAT2 and PARAFORMAT2 structures. These classes,
	TTextAttributes2 and TParaAttributes2, further extend the VCL
	classes to set individual character styles to text selections
	containing a mix of formats.

Get the long name of a file.
	
- 
Convert a byte to hexadecimal.

Window handles vs.

The
	VCL does not always create controls when you would expect. 
	Worse yet, sometimes it destroys and recreates them, silently
	destroying your changes to the WinAPI.

Please feel free to send me e-mail. In

	am happy to answer questions on just about any topic, so do not
	hesitate to ask.
	
(Well, almost any topic. Please, please do not ask me
	questions about homework assignments. Learning is a journey
	through which you make mistakes, find dead-ends, and think very
	hard. You are supposed to struggle a little, maybe a lot,
	and you would be cheating yourself if I did your assignment for
	you. If you need help with homework, please ask your
	instructor -- he is paid to teach and is, I trust, much better at
	it than I am. Having said all of that, I have answered the
	most frequently asked homework question on the FAQs
	page -- how to print the results of the C/C++ homework
	assignment when using Borland C++ Builder.)
