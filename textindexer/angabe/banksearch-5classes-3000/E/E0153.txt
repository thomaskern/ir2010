Storing Program State In The Windows Registry 
I will tell you a secret: What users really
 want is for our programs to read their minds. 
 They want the font to magically change to bold when the
 thought of bold fonts crosses their minds. They want
 the program window to leap to the front of the screen when
 they are ready to use it (and not before). They want
 -- well, they just want and want and want.... 
 
Given that I cannot read minds -- much less teach my
 programs to accomplish such magic -- then my programs must
 do the next best thing: They must remember what the
 user has told them. They must remember everything
 they "know" about the user's preferred fonts,
 window positions, recently used files, et cetera, ad
 nauseam. In other words, we need to store everything
 we know about the program's current state so that we can
 retrieve it the next time that the user runs the program. 
 
Clearly, saving information about the program's current
 state is an obvious requirement for any non-trivial
 program. Hopefully, this paper will explain enough to
 get you going and provide some useful code in the process. 
 
The Dark And Middle Ages 
Back in the Dark Ages, we simply created a binary file,
 wrote out program state information in some proprietary
 format, and read it back in when the program was next
 started. The key words here are "binary"
 and "proprietary" -- the typical user lacked the
 tools and knowledge to directly change any of the
 values. He could, of course, simply delete our
 configuration file or replace it with garbage, but that was
 his problem -- at least, until he called for help. 
 But that was all we we could do. 
 
Then came the Middle Ages and Windows 3.1 and we walked
 down the "INI file" path. For those too
 young to remember, "INI files" (or
 "initialization files") were text files, usually
 stored in the Windows directory, where we saved program
 state information in those days. To be kind, INI
 files were clumsy for storing arbitrary non-string values
 and they were too easily screwed up by users. 
 However, both the Windows API and the VCL still support INI
 files so you can use them if you wish. Or you can
 join us zombies and follow Bill Gates to The Age Of
 Enlightenment. 
 
The Age Of Enlightenment 
After WIndows 3.x came Windows 95 and Microsoft led us
 down The Registry Path. The Enlightened were now
 encouraged to store program state information in the
 Registry, a single, huge repository containing everything
 from individual user desktop preferences to system
 performance data to OLE/ActiveX control registration
 information. Although I could not find the kitchen
 sink, I am confident that it is in there somewhere. 
 
From a high level, the Registry is simply a database for
 storing arbitrary values. Using Windows API calls or
 the TRegistry VCL class, you can save integer, boolean, and
 binary data without first converting the values to strings
 (as was required with INI files -- of course, you can save
 strings, too). Even better, the Registry is a
 hierarchical database allowing you to save your program's
 state data in logical groups if desired. 
 
Microsoft has set up certain rules, standards, and
 conventions for using the Registry. By following
 these rules, you can do things like setting an icon for a
 document file that will be displayed in Explorer and
 registering the program to be started when the document
 file is opened. Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)
 uses the Registry extensively to locate OLE servers and
 services. The list goes on and on. 
 
There are way too many "rules, standards, and
 conventions" for using these Registry features for me
 to cover in any useful detail here. Instead, this
 paper will be limited to outlining the basic Registry
 structure and describing how you can save your program's
 state information into it. Then, I will discuss the
 basic VCL methods used to store and retrieve strings,
 integers, boolean, and arbitrary binary values. 
 Finally, I will present code to simplify storing and
 retrieving string lists, font information, and printer
 selections. 
 
The Structure Of The Registry 
There are four elements, or levels, to the Registry: 
 
- Root Keys. 
- Subkeys. 
- Value Names. 
- Data Values. 
I think of the Registry as being a lot like a typical
 file system. Root Keys are rather like drive letters
 -- they are at the top of the hierarchy and you cannot add
 one on a whim, at least not as far as I know. There
 are four predefined Root keys (technically handles
 to keys): 
 HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
HKEY_CURRENT_USER
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
HKEY_USERS
 Subkeys are rather like directory paths. With
 directories, you specify a top level directory, then a
 subdirectory within that, and so on. Subkeys are
 similarly constructed. Importantly, you can add a new
 one just as easily as you can create a new subdirectory
 when you need one. (Note: On WIndows NT, you must
 have sufficient security rights to use or modify the
 Registry.) Subkeys look something like this: 
 \Software\Microsoft\Outlook Express\Mail
 Value Names are much like file names. They are
 the names of the containers for data. Just as you store
 data in a file, you store data in a Value Name. And,
 just as you can have an unlimited number of files within a
 directory, you can have as many Value Names in a subkey as
 you need. For example, within the subkey above on my
 machine is the following Value Name: 
 Message HTML Allow 8bit in Header
 To complete the analogy, Data Values correspond to the
 data we store in files. That is, you store a Data
 Value in the Registry within a specified Value Name. 
 Each Data Value has a specific type associated with it when
 it is stored: The native Registry types include
 strings, boolean, DWORD, and binary. The VCL adds
 TDateTime, TCurrency, and other types. In the Value
 Name above, I have the following Data Value (which I take
 to be a boolean false) on my PC: 
 0x00000000
 Now, there are some differences. In the file
 system world, we open files and then read or write
 data. In the Registry world, we do the equivalent of
 opening directories (not the files) and, continuing in the
 file system context, read or write the entire contents of
 the file in one big gulp. That is, we open a
 key/subkey and read then read/write Data Values from the
 Value Names in that open key. 
 
Another difference is that we do not specify the type of
 the data in files in the file system itself; however, the
 Registry does record which of the native data types you are
 storing in each Value Name/Data Value. 
 
I have rewritten the above few paragraphs ten or twelve
 times, and I fear that it is still about as clear as
 mud. Hopefully, all of this will get clearer as we
 get to the examples in the next section. However,
 before we go there I should warn you that both the Windows
 API help and the VCL help use rather different
 terminology. What I call Value Names, the WinAPI
 calls "values" and the VCL calls
 "Names." What I call Data Values, the
 WInAPI calls "data" and the VCL calls
 "values." Neither of these conventions
 seems particularly clear to me, so I chose my own
 convention. Hopefully, the terminology will become
 less important after you have gone through the examples. 
 
The First Example -- Saving Data 
They say, "a picture is worth a thousand
 words." If that is true, then a code sample
 should be worth, perhaps, a thousand machine
 instructions. So let's jump right into an example. 
 
Reading and writing values to and from the Registry is a
 five step process: 
 
- Create a TRegistry object. 
- Create a new Registry key or open an existing one. 
- Read or write values to or from the Registry. 
- Close the Registry key. 
- Destroy the TRegistry object. 
We need to decide on a Root key and subkey where we will
 store our data. For the example, we will follow
 Microsoft's advice (even though they frequently do not) and
 use the HKEY_CURRENT_USER Root key and a subkey something
 like this: 
 \Software\company name\product name\version number
 The first subkey level, "Software," is
 predefined. For the remaining values, the examples
 that follow use "My Great Software Company,"
 "My Killer App," and version
 "1.0." Naturally, you should change these
 to something unique for your applications. 
 
For our first example, we will save an arbitrary string,
 presumably the user's name, to the Registry in a Value Name
 called "User Name." Here's the code in
 full, with comments embedded in the code. 
 // for convenience, we define the subkey string as a macro
#define REGISTRY_KEY AnsiString("\\Software\\My Great Software Company\\My Killer App\\1.0")
// SaveUserName() - Saves a string to the Registry as the Value Name "User Name"
// Parameters:
// username - the string to save
// Returns:
// true on success; false on failure
// Exceptions:
// Should not raise exceptions (we hope)
//
bool SaveUserName(AnsiString username)
 // create a VCL TRegistry object
 TRegistry* reg;
 try {
 reg = new TRegistry;
 }
 catch (...) {
 return false;
 }
 
 // set the registry root key to the correct place for 
 // storing an individual user's information (HKEY_CURRENT_USER)
 if (reg->RootKey != HKEY_CURRENT_USER) {
 reg->RootKey = HKEY_CURRENT_USER;
 if (reg->RootKey != HKEY_CURRENT_USER) {
 delete reg;
 return false;
 }
 }
 
 // set the registry key to the key where we will store
 // our unique program's data
 if (!reg->OpenKey(REGISTRY_KEY /* #define'd above*/, 
 true /* create the key if it does not exist */)) {
 delete reg;
 return false;
 }
 
 // try to write the value to the registry
 try {
 reg->WriteString("User Name", username);
 }
 // catch all exceptions -- return failure
 catch (...) {
 delete reg;
 return false;
 }
 
 // successfully saved data so delete the reg object
 // and return success
 delete reg;
 return true;
}
 There are only a few points to add to the comments in
 the code. First, in many file systems you must create
 a subdirectory before creating a subdirectory within that
 directory. However, you can create an arbitrary
 number of Registry subkeys in a single OpenKey()
 call. That is, even though the subkey
 "\Software\My Great Software Company" may not
 exist before the OpenKey() call, the entire subkey path
 "\Software\My Great Software Company\My Killer
 App\1.0" is created in the single OpenKey() call. 
 
Second, notice that we did not explicitly close the key
 after using it as mentioned in step 4 of the 5 step process
 listed above. Closing the key is optional with the
 VCL TRegistry class because open keys are automatically
 closed when TRegistry objects are destroyed. I listed
 closing keys only in case you ever need to read or code the
 equivalent Windows API calls. 
 
Third, recall that we stored the data with
 WriteString(). WriteString() does more than let the VCL
 know what kind of parameters to expect -- it also lets the
 Registry store the data type (string) with the data
 itself. This will become more important in the next
 section when we read the data back. 
 
Last, note that the above code is structured to trap all
 exceptions and return false on any failure. Not all
 of the remaining examples will be this careful. 
 
The Second Example -- Retrieving Data 
Next, let's read back the data we saved in the prior
 example. In my first attempt, I declared the call as:
 
 bool GetUserName(AnsiString& username);
 because I thought it should look just like the
 SaveUserName() call above. Unfortunately, you cannot
 pass an AnsiString by reference, at least not as I
 understand it. So we have to restructure the call to
 return the "success" indicator in a passed
 reference. The code looks like this: 
 // GetUserName() - retrieve the string saved in the "User Name" Value Name
// Parameters:
// success - a reference to boolean value defined in the caller (of course)
// Returns:
// the retrieved Registry value on success; an empty string on failure;
// the parameter "success" is true if successful, false otherwise
// Exceptions:
// Should not raise exceptions (we hope)
// 
AnsiString GetUserName(bool& success)
 // initialize success indicator to failure
 success = false;
 
 // create a TRegistry object
 TRegistry* reg;
 try {
 reg = new TRegistry;
 }
 catch (...) {
 return "";
 }
 
 // set the registry root key to the correct place for 
 // storing an individual user's information (HKEY_CURRENT_USER)
 if (reg->RootKey != HKEY_CURRENT_USER) {
 reg->RootKey = HKEY_CURRENT_USER;
 if (reg->RootKey != HKEY_CURRENT_USER) {
 delete reg;
 return "";
 }
 }
 
 // set the registry key to the key where we stored
 // our unique program's data
 if (!reg->OpenKey(REGISTRY_KEY /* #define'd above*/, 
 false /* do not create the key if it does not exist */)) {
 delete reg;
 return "";
 }
 
 // make sure the value exists before trying to read it
 if (!reg->ValueExists("User Name")) return "";
 // try to read a value from the registry
 try {
 AnsiString s = reg->ReadString("User Name", username);
 delete reg;
 success = true;
 return s;
 }
 // catch all exceptions
 catch (...) {
 }
 // we must have failed... 
 delete reg;
 return "";
}
 The main thing to note about the above code is that we
 made sure that the subkey existed before reading it. 
 This was necessary because TRegistry::ReadString() does not
 return an error nor does it raise an exception if the Value
 Name does not exist. However, this might not be good
 enough. 
 
Remember that the data type (boolean, string, DWORD,
 binary) is stored with the key. What would happen if
 we had stored "User Name" as a boolean? 
 What if the user modified the entry with RegEdit.exe but
 changed the type? The value would exist and our check
 would not fail. However, TRegistry::ReadString() does
 not raise an exception upon failure -- it simply returns a
 NULL string. In this case, the above example would
 return success and an empty string. 
 
The point is that if you really want to trap all
 potential errors, you will have to work harder. In
 addition to the above check, you should check the type of
 the value with TRegistry::GetDataInfo() before attempting
 to read it. Of course, after reading it, you will
 need to make sure that the Data Value is sane. 
 
VCL Classes Directly Supported By TRegistry 
The TRegistry VCL class supports a storing and
 retrieving a number of different types and classes of data
 to and from the Registry. 
 
 
 
 
Data Type 
 
 
 
 
Read Method 
 
 
 
 
Write Method 
 
 
 
	 
Arbitrary Binary Data 
	 
 
 
	 
ReadBinaryData 
	 
 
 
	 
WriteBinaryData 
	 
 
 
	 
Boolean 
	 
 
 
	 
ReadBool 
	 
 
 
	 
WriteBool 
	 
 
 
	 
TCurrency 
	 
 
 
	 
ReadCurrency 
	 
 
 
	 
WriteCurrency 
	 
 
 
	 
TDateTime 
	 
 
 
	 
ReadDate 
	 
 
 
	 
WriteDate 
	 
 
 
	 
TDateTime 
	 
 
 
	 
ReadDateTime 
	 
 
 
	 
WriteDateTime 
	 
 
 
	 
double 
	 
 
 
	 
ReadFloat 
	 
 
 
	 
WriteFloat 
	 
 
 
	 
int 
	 
 
 
	 
ReadInteger 
	 
 
 
	 
WriteInteger 
	 
 
 
	 
AnsiString 
	 
 
 
	 
ReadString 
	 
 
 
	 
WriteString 
	 
 
 
	 
TDateTime 
	 
 
 
	 
ReadTime 
	 
 
 
	 
WriteTime 
	 
 
 
Hopefully, you should be able to modify the above
 examples to use these methods without much trouble. 
 
For any data type not directly supported by the VCL
 TRegistry methods, you can use the ReadBinaryData() and
 WriteBinaryData() methods. Personally, I avoid that
 approach. It is usually not a great deal harder to
 save each piece of information from a structure
 individually, and this makes it significantly easier to
 view the Registry entries and debug the code. 
 
If you decide to use ReadBinaryData() and
 WriteBinaryData(), keep in mind that pointer types are
 essentially useless in any program execution other than the
 one in which they were saved. It would be a great
 temptation to save arbitrary structures using the binary
 read/write functions, but, if they contain pointers, you
 will have to find other techniques. See the below
 examples for ways of dealing with this. 
 
Using TRegistry With Other Classes 
I found it, shall we say, mildly frustrating that the
 TRegistry class provides methods for storing things like
 TDateTime, but does not directly support saving important
 classes like TPrinter and TFont. My current project
 is pretty much a replacement for WordPad -- fonts,
 printers, and string lists are scattered throughout the
 project. 
 
The following code was developed to address these
 shortcomings. You will almost certainly need to
 modify it. During the course of writing this paper, I
 discovered that my code potentially leaked memory -- I was
 not deleting TRegistry objects everywhere that I needed to
 delete them. I may have missed such potential
 problems in the following code, so use it carefully. 
 In particular, the code for saving and restoring printer
 state is highly suspect. It certainly does not make
 all of the defensive checks that production code should
 make. 
 
In other words, the following code is here for
 study. So study it -- but do not assume that there
 are no problems. 
 [ registry.h ]

 // note font.Style.contains(fsXXX), does not, for some reason,

}
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

{

 font.Height = RegValueExists(reg, name + "Height").ReadInteger(name + "Height");
 TFontStyles fs; // need because working directly with font.Style doesn't work...
 if (RegValueExists(reg, name + "Bold").ReadBool(name + "Bold"))
 fs RootKey != HKEY_CURRENT_USER) {
 reg->RootKey = HKEY_CURRENT_USER;
 if (reg->RootKey != HKEY_CURRENT_USER)
 throw new ERegistryException("Failed 1);
 }
 // set the registry key to the key where we will store
 // our unique program's data
 if (!reg->OpenKey(REGISTRY_KEY /* #define'd above*/, 
 true /* create the key if it does not exist */))
 throw new ERegistryException("Failed 1");
 // try to write the value to the registry
 try {
 ::SaveToRegistry(*reg, "Current Printer", *Printer();
 ::SaveToRegistry(*reg, "Current Font", *(RichEdit1->Font);
 TStringList* list = new TStringList();
 try {
 list->Assign(RichEdit1->Lines);
 ::SaveToRegistry(*reg, "Current List", list);
 }
 catch {
 delete list;
 throw new ERegistryException("Failed 2");
 }
 }
 }
 // catch all exceptions -- return failure
 catch (...) {
 delete reg;
 return false;
 }
 // successfully saved data so delete the reg object
 // and return success
 delete reg;
 return true;
}
 The above example is somewhat complicated by efforts to
 release storage for all dynamically created objects
 whenever an exception is raised. On the other hand,
 it is pretty simplistic from the caller's standpoint. 
 For example, although the return value indicates failure,
 it does not tell the caller at what point the code failed.
 You would probably want to either throw exceptions (instead
 of returning true/false) or return unique error codes for
 each point of failure. 
 
In spite of these simplifications, the above code should
 give you an idea of what is involved in using TRegistry for
 arbitrary classes. Of course, I would welcome
 improvements....
