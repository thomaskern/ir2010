Printing and Previewing Rich Edit
Controls 
Part 3: Previewing Rich Edit Controls 
Part 2 of this paper demonstrated how to print the
 contents to a Rich Edit control to an arbitrary area on a
 page. This part of the paper describes how to
 implement a Rich Edit print preview feature in your
 project. If you have not already studied Part 2, I
 suggest that you do so now. Much of the code in this
 part of the paper assumes that you understand all of the
 concepts in Part 2. 
 
Overview 
One must assume that the original Rich Edit design goal
 was to render identically on all devices. Sadly, Rich
 Edit controls fall short of this ideal &#150; if you need a
 flawless print preview feature, you have several choices: 
 
- Rewrite the code I present here to render to a metafile
and then draw the metafile on the window. At one
point, I tried this and did not like the results. Perhaps
you will fare better. 
- Develop your own RTF parsing and rendering code. 
No small task, to be sure. 
- Buy someone else's tool. But, where's the fun in
that? 
On the other hand, if you can live with a few
 imperfections, Rich Edit controls can come pretty close and
 the code is not too difficult. 
 
Before you make a decision, let me describe the behavior
 that I have encountered. First, things seem pretty
 close to perfection if you are not scaling the page to less
 than 100% of the actual printed size (as represented on the
 screen). What happens when scaling to less than 100%
 is something like this: 
 
- The control rarely, if ever, draws text that is wider
than the rendering rectangle. However, the text may
be scaled to a "next lower size" that leaves a
right margin that is too wide. This appears to happen
in increments that correspond to integral rounding errors,
possibly related to font scaling. To see this
behavior, use the sample code and bring up a preview
window. Then resize the preview window slowly. 
- The control may scale the lines vertically beyond the
size of the rendering rectangle. In other words, the
text is too tall. It will start at the top margin
correctly but extend beyond the proper bottom margin. 
- On yet the other hand, word wrap and page breaks occur
at the correct points. 
I can live with this &#150; I just scale to 100% when I
 need to see things accurately and advise the user that the
 right and bottom margins may be clipped otherwise. 
 The bugs do not really interfere with getting a general
 idea of the page layout, which is what I really
 wanted. For what it is worth, the technique used in
 this paper is the same method used by WordPad&#146;s print
 preview feature and has the same flaws. 
 
To demonstrate all of this, we will code up a little
 extension to the Part 2 example to: 
 
- Create a preview window (a TForm) in which we will
display the preview. 
- Build a table of page offsets that correspond to the
true printed pages. 
- Display the first page of output scaled to fit within
the preview window. 
- Draw an outline rectangle that corresponds to the
rendering rectangle to demonstrate the Rich Edit control
bugs more clearly. 
The Code 
First, add a form to the Part 2 project and add the main
 form header include file to the new form. Include the
 vcl\printers.hpp and STL vector headers and declare the
 TPageOffsets structure to the new form's *.cpp file. 
 The code should look something like this: 
 #include 
#pragma hdrstop
#include "TestRichEditPnPPreviewForm.h"
#include "TestRichEditPnPForm.h"
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include 
#include // for stl
typedef struct tagTPageOffset {
 long int Start;
 long int End;
 RECT rendRect;
 } TPageOffsets;
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#pragma package(smart_init)
#pragma resource "*.dfm"
TPreviewForm *PreviewForm;
 Add the following to public portion of the class
 declaration (in the preview form header file): 
 __fastcall ~TPreviewForm(void);
void DrawRichEdit(void);
TPanel* PreviewPanel;
 Note that this adds a destructor method, a DrawRichEdit
 member function, and a TPanel variable. 
 
We will draw the scaled Rich Edit control's output on a
 TPanel. To facilitate this, define a TPreviewPanel
 class in the *.cpp file as follows: 
 class TPreviewPanel : public TPanel
{
public:
 __fastcall virtual TPreviewPanel(Classes::TComponent* AOwner) : TPanel(AOwner) { };
 __fastcall virtual ~TPreviewPanel(void) { };
 __fastcall virtual void Paint(void) {
 TPanel::Paint();
 PreviewForm->DrawRichEdit();
 };
 __property Canvas;
};
 The two reasons for deriving the class are (1) to call
 the PreviewForm::DrawRichEdit() method when the panel is
 painted and (2) to make the panel's Canvas property public.
 
 
Modify the TPreviewForm constructor to create an
 instance of TPreviewPanel and add the destructor to delete
 the TPreviewPanel instance. 
 __fastcall TPreviewForm::TPreviewForm(TComponent* Owner) : TForm(Owner)
{
 PreviewPanel = new TPreviewPanel(this);
 PreviewPanel->Parent = this;
 PreviewPanel->Color = clWhite;
} 
__fastcall TPreviewForm::~TPreviewForm(void)
{
 if (PreviewPanel) delete PreviewPanel;
}
 We want the TPreviewPanel to approximate the scaled
 dimensions of the printed page. Whenever the parent
 form is resized, we need to rescale and center the panel on
 the form. To do this, add an OnResize event to the
 form and add the following code: 
 void __fastcall TPreviewForm::FormResize(TObject *Sender)
{
 // get the printer dimensions.
 int wPage = ::GetDeviceCaps(Printer()->Handle, PHYSICALWIDTH);
 int hPage = ::GetDeviceCaps(Printer()->Handle, PHYSICALHEIGHT);
 // get the client window dimensions.
 int wClient = ClientWidth;
 int hClient = ClientHeight;
 // initially adjust width to match height
 wClient = ::MulDiv(ClientHeight, wPage, hPage);
 // if that doesn't fit, then do it the other way
 if (wClient > ClientWidth) {
 wClient = ClientWidth;
 hClient = ::MulDiv(ClientWidth, hPage, wPage);
 // center the page in the window
 PreviewPanel->Top = (ClientHeight - hClient) >> 1; // divide by two
 }
 else // center the page in the window 
 PreviewPanel->Left = (ClientWidth - wClient) >> 1; // divide by two
 // now set size of panel
 PreviewPanel->Width = wClient;
 PreviewPanel->Height = hClient;
}
 The DrawRichEdit() method renders the contents of the
 control on the preview panel. Much of the code is
 very close to the code used to print the control in Part
 2. The first part of the method is identical to the
 printing code: 
 void TPreviewForm::DrawRichEdit(void)
{
 int wPage = ::GetDeviceCaps(Printer()->Handle, PHYSICALWIDTH);
 int hPage = ::GetDeviceCaps(Printer()->Handle, PHYSICALHEIGHT);
 int xPPI = ::GetDeviceCaps(Printer()->Handle, LOGPIXELSX);
 int yPPI = ::GetDeviceCaps(Printer()->Handle, LOGPIXELSY);
 int wTwips = ::MulDiv(wPage, 1440, xPPI);
 int hTwips = ::MulDiv(hPage, 1440, yPPI);
 RECT pageRect;
 pageRect.left = pageRect.top = 0;
 pageRect.right = wTwips;
 pageRect.bottom = hTwips;
 RECT rendRect;
 rendRect.left = rendRect.top = 0;
 rendRect.right = pageRect.right - 1440 * 4;
 rendRect.bottom = pageRect.bottom - 1440 * 4;
 std::vector FPageOffsets;
 TPageOffsets po;
 po.Start = 0;
 We will be using several device contexts (DCs), so
 let's go ahead and create variables for them. 
 HDC hdcDesktop = ::GetWindowDC(::GetDesktopWindow());
 HDC hdcCanvas = dynamic_cast(PreviewPanel)->Canvas->Handle;
 HDC hdcPrinter = Printer()->Handle;
 Next, define and initialize a FORMATRANGE structure. 
 TFormatRange fr;
 fr.hdc = hdcDesktop;
 fr.hdcTarget = hdcPrinter;
 fr.chrg.cpMin = po.Start;
 fr.chrg.cpMax = -1;
 We will need the size of the text in the control. 
 int lastOffset = ::SendMessage(Form1->RichEdit1->Handle, WM_GETTEXTLENGTH, 0, 0);
 Clear the control's formatting buffer before rendering.
 
 ::SendMessage(Form1->RichEdit1->Handle, EM_FORMATRANGE, (WPARAM) 0, (LPARAM) 0);
 Here is the tricky part. We need to scale the
 rendering DC to match the size of the printed page in
 printer device units. 
 ::SaveDC(hdcCanvas);
 ::SetMapMode(hdcCanvas, MM_TEXT); // set to device units
 ::SetMapMode(hdcCanvas, MM_ANISOTROPIC); // inherits prior mapping mode
 ::SetMapMode(hdcPrinter, MM_TEXT); // set to device units
 ::SetWindowExtEx(hdcCanvas, pageRect.right, pageRect.bottom, NULL);
 int xDesktopPPI = ::GetDeviceCaps(hdcDesktop, LOGPIXELSX);
 int yDesktopPPI = ::GetDeviceCaps(hdcDesktop, LOGPIXELSY);
 ::ScaleWindowExtEx(hdcCanvas, xDesktopPPI, 1440, yDesktopPPI, 1440, NULL);
 ::SetViewportExtEx(hdcCanvas, PreviewPanel->ClientWidth, PreviewPanel->ClientHeight, NULL);
 Apparently, the Rich Edit control reduces the width of
 the rendering area by the amount of the left offset to the
 printable portion of the page when printing. This is
 a little odd to me because none of the Windows API GDI
 functions care whether you are printing within the
 printable portion of the page. Further, this occurs
 even though the rendering rectangle is already within the
 printable portion of the page. Anyway, this does not
 seem to happen when the rendering DC is the screen so we
 need to manually adjust the rectangle ourselves. 
 int xPrinterOffset = ::MulDiv(::GetDeviceCaps(hdcPrinter, PHYSICALOFFSETX), 1440, xPPI);
 int yPrinterOffset = ::MulDiv(::GetDeviceCaps(hdcPrinter, PHYSICALOFFSETY), 1440, yPPI);
 rendRect.left += xPrinterOffset >> 1;
 rendRect.right -= xPrinterOffset - (xPrinterOffset >> 1);
 rendRect.top += yPrinterOffset >> 1;
 rendRect.bottom -= yPrinterOffset - (yPrinterOffset >> 1);
 Remember that we are hardcoding two-inch margins. 
 int xOffset = ::MulDiv(PreviewPanel->ClientWidth ClientHeight RichEdit1->Handle, EM_FORMATRANGE, (WPARAM) 0, (LPARAM) &fr);
 po.End = fr.chrg.cpMin - 1;
 po.rendRect = fr.rc;
 FPageOffsets.push_back(po);
 } while (fr.chrg.cpMin != -1 && fr.chrg.cpMin RichEdit1->Handle, EM_FORMATRANGE, (WPARAM) 1, (LPARAM) &fr);
 As I mentioned, the text may be drawn outside of the
 rendering rectangle. To make that easier to see,
 let's draw a rectangle that shows where the rendering
 rectangle should be. 
 ::SetMapMode(hdcCanvas, MM_TEXT);
 ::SetViewportOrgEx(hdcCanvas, 0, 0, NULL);
 RECT frameRect = rendRect;
 OffsetRect(&frameRect, 1440 + 1440, 1440 + 1440);
 int xFactor = ::MulDiv(PreviewPanel->ClientWidth, (pageRect.right - rendRect.right) >> 1, pageRect.right);
 int yFactor = ::MulDiv(PreviewPanel->ClientHeight, (pageRect.bottom - rendRect.bottom) >> 1, pageRect.bottom);
 frameRect.left = xFactor;
 frameRect.right = PreviewPanel->ClientWidth - xFactor;
 frameRect.top = yFactor;
 frameRect.bottom = PreviewPanel->ClientHeight - yFactor;
 ::FrameRect(hdcCanvas, &frameRect, ::GetStockObject(BLACK_BRUSH));
 To wrap up, we restore the panel's canvas to the
 original state, release the desktop DC, clear the Rich Edit
 control's formatting buffer, empty the page offset table,
 and close the DrawRichEdit() method. 
 ::RestoreDC(hdcCanvas, -1);
 ::ReleaseDC(::GetDesktopWindow(), hdcDesktop);
 ::SendMessage(Form1->RichEdit1->Handle, EM_FORMATRANGE, (WPARAM) 0, (LPARAM) 0);
 FPageOffsets.erase(FPageOffsets.begin(), FPageOffsets.end());
}
 You now have a preview window. The last step is
 to go back to the main form and add code to the Preview
 button&#146;s OnClick handler to show the form: 
 void __fastcall TForm1::PreviewBtnClick(TObject *Sender)
{
 PreviewForm->ShowModal();
}
