Q: Allow the user to browse for a folder
Answer:
There are two ways to allow the user to browse for a folder. First, there's the hard way,
using the API function SHBrowseForFolder. Then there's the easy way, using the
VCL's SelectFolder function. SelectFolder is documented in the BCB
help system. This function works nicely, but unfortunately, it displays a form that uses
the old Win 3.1 icons for folders and drives. SHBrowseForFolder shows a more
contemporary dialog that contains the newer icons that are part of Windows 95, Windows 98,
and Windows NT4. This FAQ explains how to utilize the SHBrowseForFolder function
in a C++Builder project. Figure 1 shows the dialog box that pops up when you call SHBrowseForFolder.
 
Figure 1. The SHBrowseForFolder dialog
SHBrowseForFolder is part of the shell interface API. The prototype for the
function is located in SHLOBJ.H. Like most API functions,
SHBrowseForFolder takes a large, inexplicable structure as an argument.
The structure's type name is BROWSEINFO. You fill in the members of this
structure to control how the browse dialog will behave. After the user closes the dialog,
SHBrowseForFolder returns a pointer to an ID list (PIDL) that indicates
what folder was selected.
One confusing aspect of SHBrowseForFolder is that it doesn't return the directory
path to the folder that the user selected. One might presume that the BROWSEINFO
structure would contain a string for the directory path. Of course, this would
have made way too much sense, so Microsoft decided to implement an elaborate mechanism
that requires you to work for that directory string. As mentioned earlier,
SHBrowseForFolder returns a PIDL, which is a relatively worthless object. The
API contains a function called SHGetPathFromIDList that can convert a PIDL into
a directory path string.
The code segment below explains how to use SHBrowseForFolder.
#include 
void __fastcall TForm1::Button1Click(TObject *Sender)
{
 BROWSEINFO info;
 char szDir[MAX_PATH];
 char szDisplayName[MAX_PATH];
 LPITEMIDLIST pidl;
 LPMALLOC pShellMalloc;
 // SHBrowseForFolder returns a PIDL. The memory for the PIDL is
 // allocated by the shell. Eventually, we will need to free this
 // memory, so we need to get a pointer to the shell malloc COM
 // object that will free the PIDL later on.
 if(SHGetMalloc(&pShellMalloc) == NO_ERROR)
 {
 // if we were able to get the shell malloc object,
 // then proceed by initializing the BROWSEINFO stuct
 memset(&info, 0x00,sizeof(info));
 info.hwndOwner = Handle; // Owner window
 info.pidlRoot = 0; // root folder
 info.pszDisplayName = szDisplayName; // return display name
 info.lpszTitle = "Browse Title"; // label caption
 info.ulFlags = BIF_RETURNONLYFSDIRS; // config flags
 info.lpfn = 0; // callback function
 // execute the browsing dialog
 pidl = SHBrowseForFolder(&info);
 // pidl will be null if they cancel the browse dialog.
 // pidl will be not null when they select a folder
 if(pidl)
 {
 // try to convert the pidl to a display string
 // return is true if success
 if(SHGetPathFromIDList(pidl, szDir))
 {
 // set one caption to the directory path
 Label1->Caption = szDir;
 }
 // set another caption based on the display name
 Label2->Caption = info.pszDisplayName;
 // use the shell malloc com object to free the pidl.
 // then call Relasee to signal that we don't need
 // the shell malloc object anymore
 pShellMalloc->Free(pidl);
 }
 pShellMalloc->Release();
 }
}
Understanding the purpose of SHGetMalloc
SHBrowseForFolder returns a PIDL object. The PIDL is allocated by the shell's task
allocator. When you're done using the PIDL, it must be released by the task allocator. In
order to properly free the PIDL object, you must obtain a reference to the shell's task
allocator by calling the SHGetMalloc function. You can then use the task allocator
to deallocate the PIDL.
SHGetMalloc returns a pointer to an IMalloc COM object. The IMalloc COM interface
is documented in the OLE Reference MS help file that comes with C++Builder. If you're not
up to speed with COM (like...who is), then think of the IMalloc COM object as just another
C++ object that has methods that you can call. The method that we need for this FAQ is the
Free method. Free will release the PIDL object. When you're finished using the
task alloctor, call the Release method of the IMalloc object. The pseudo-code below depicts the
relationship between the COM methods and regular C++ code that we are more familiar with.
COM code C++ psuedo-equivalent
LPMALLOC pShellMalloc; // think of pShellMalloc as an object that
SHGetMalloc(&pShellMalloc); // handles new and delete for OS shell tasks
LPITEMIDLIST pidl; Tpidl *pidl;
pidl = SHBrowseForFolder(...); pidl = new Tpidl();
pShellMalloc->Free(pidl); delete pidl;
pShellMalloc->Release();
The BROWSEINFO structure
The BROWSEINFO structure allows you to control the appearance and behavior
of the SHBrowseForFolder dialog. Each BROWSEINFO structure is described
below.
typedef struct {
 HWND hwndOwner;
 LPCITEMIDLIST pidlRoot;
 LPSTR pszDisplayName;
 LPCSTR lpszTitle;
 UINT ulFlags;
 BFFCALLBACK lpfn;
 LPARAM lParam;
 int iImage;
} BROWSEINFO;
hwndOwner: Specifies the handle of the owner window of the browsing dialog. If you
supply an owner, the browse dialog will behave modally with respect to the owner window.
The user will not be able to interact with your program while the browse dialog is displayed.
This is usually the effect that you want. Also, when you specify an owner, the taskbar will
not display a separate icon for the browsing dialog. If you set hwndOwner to
NULL, then the browsing dialog behaves like a separate window that is not part
of your program. Users will still be able to interact with your program and the browsing
dialog will have its own taskbar icon.
pidlRoot: Specifies the root PIDL, or directory, of the browsing dialog. The root
PIDL acts like the base folder for the dialog. The user cannot backup past the root folder.
For example, let's say that you want your users to select a folder on the C: drive. You
could obtain a PIDL for the C:\ drive (how you obtain that is complicated enough to
warrant its own FAQ), and then assign this PIDL to the pidlRoot member of
BROWSEINFO. The browsing dialog would not allow the user to backup past the root
directory of the C: drive.
pszDisplayName: The browse dialog writes the title of the selected folder into
the pszDisplayName member of BROWSEINFO. You should point this member to a buffer that can
hold at least MAX_PATH characters. Note that the display name is not the same
thing as the directory path to the folder.
lpszTitle: This parameter allows you to specify text that the browse info dialog
will display just above the directory treeview (see Figure 1).
ulFlags: Controls the type of folders that the user can browse for. The
possible values are:
BIF_BROWSEFORCOMPUTER Browses only for computers (network neighborhood).
BIF_BROWSEFORPRINTER Browses for network printers (somewhat useless).
BIF_DONTGOBELOWDOMAIN Prevents display of network folders below domain level.
BIF_RETURNFSANCESTORS Returns file system items (drives and directories).
BIF_RETURNONLYFSDIRS Returns file system ancestors (so what are those??).
BIF_STATUSTEXT	 Displays a label on the browse dialog.
Be careful when trying to control SHBrowseFolder by altering the ulFlags structure member.
You might not get the results that you expect. For example, if you specify the BIF_BROWSEFORPRINTER flag, you
might expect that the user will be able to select a local printer that is connected directly to their PC. This turns out
to be false. The BIF_BROWSEFORPRINTER only allows the user to browse for network printers. Also, it doesn't
seem to prevent them form selecting a file directory (at least, not when I tried it).
lpfn: Pointer to a callback routine. An example is shown below.
lParam: Value that is used in the callback routine.
iImage: The folder that is selected by SHBrowseForFolder will have an associated icon of some
kind. When SHBrowseForFolder closes, iImage contains an integer value. This value is the selected
folder's index into the system imagelist. If you don't know what the system imagelist is, see my FAQ on
displaying the same icons that Windows displays.
Using a SHBrowseForFolder callback routine
Two of the BROWSEINFO members pertain to some mystical callback hocus pocus. So what is this callback jazz
all about? The callback routine exists so you can customize the behavior of the SHBrowseForFolder dialog. For
example, if you don't like (or don't understand, like my) why the ulFlags parameter doesn't seem to behave correctly,
you can take control of the browse dialog yourself by using a callback. The callback allows you to enable and disable
the browse dialog's OK button. You can also navigate the dialog to a specific folder or set the status text.
Here is a code example that demonstrates how to utilize the browse dialog's callback function.
This code sets the status text of the dialog, and it initialize the browse dialog to a specific directory. The code
also tracks the current selection in the browse dialog and displays the folder path in a label.
int __stdcall BrowseProc(HWND hwnd,UINT uMsg, LPARAM lParam, LPARAM lpData )
{
 char szDir[MAX_PATH];
 switch(uMsg)
 {
 case BFFM_INITIALIZED:
 SendMessage(hwnd, BFFM_SETSTATUSTEXT,0, (LPARAM)"Greetings");
 // Set the initial directory. If WPARAM is TRUE, then LPARAM is a
 // string that contains the path. If WPARAM is FALSE, then LPARAM
 // should be a lovely PIDL
 SendMessage(hwnd, BFFM_SETSELECTION, TRUE, (LPARAM)"C:\\Delphi4");
 break;
 case BFFM_SELCHANGED:
 if(SHGetPathFromIDList((LPITEMIDLIST)lParam, szDir))
 Form1->Label3->Caption = szDir;
 break;
 }
 return 0;
}
void __fastcall TForm1::Button1Click(TObject *Sender)
{
 BROWSEINFO info;
 char szDir[MAX_PATH];
 char szDisplayName[MAX_PATH];
 LPITEMIDLIST pidl;
 LPMALLOC pShellMalloc;
 if(SHGetMalloc(&pShellMalloc) == NO_ERROR)
 {
 memset(&info, 0x00, sizeof(info));
 info.hwndOwner = 0;
 info.pidlRoot = NULL;
 info.pszDisplayName = szDisplayName;
 info.lpszTitle = "Browse Title";
 info.ulFlags = BIF_RETURNONLYFSDIRS|BIF_STATUSTEXT;
 info.lpfn = BrowseProc; // callback function
 pidl = SHBrowseForFolder(&info);
 if(pidl)
 {
 if(SHGetPathFromIDList(pidl, szDir))
 {
 Label1->Caption = szDir;
 }
 Label2->Caption = info.pszDisplayName;
 pShellMalloc->Free(pidl);
 pShellMalloc->Release();
 }
 }
}
