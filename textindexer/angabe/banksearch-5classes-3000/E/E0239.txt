Supporting Threads in
Standard C++ Part 1
Phil Bass
Why Threads?
Shortly after the C++ standard was announced I read an article explaining
what the standardisation committee will do next. There is still work to do, it
said. Although the standard is not allowed to change for 7 years some parts
will need to be clarified and ambiguities and inconsistencies will need to be
resolved. At some stage the committee will also have to consider the next C++
standard. The article urged its readers to report parts of the existing
standard that could be improved and to submit suggestions for its next
incarnation.
I thought about this for a while. It seems to me that the biggest problem
with C++ is its sheer size and complexity. Commercial organisations need to
spend a lot of time and money training C++ programmers. Many of them feel it
isn&#146;t worth the investment. What&#146;s wrong with C, Java or Visual
Basic? Or simply C++ as a &#147;better C&#148;? To put it another way, C++ is
an excellent language for writing efficient, high-quality, low-level software.
But most software isn&#146;t like that. So, if C++ is to remain a main-stream
language, it needs to become smaller, simpler and easier to use - without
losing any of its power and flexibility.
Unfortunately, but I had no idea how this could be done. So I thought some
more and decided that the standard could be improved by making it bigger. Like
C before it, C++ assumes an underlying (abstract) machine. It is a
single-processor, single-process, single-thread machine. And most modern
software is written to run in an environment of networked machines running
multi-threading, multi-processing operating systems. If standard C++
doesn&#146;t provide support for such environments C++ programs will always be
platform-specific and the benefits of having a standard will inevitably be
eroded.
A Hierarchy of Architectures
So, I asked myself, &#147;What other facilities do we need in C++ to support
modern object-oriented, distributed-processing software environments?&#148;.
The answer I gave myself was this:
- threads and thread synchronisation mechanisms; 
- processes, inter-process communications and process synchronisation
mechanisms; 
- networking and support for distributed objects. 
1.I thought of this as a hierarchy of architectures, each layer adding
facilities to those of the layer beneath. For completeness, I included support
for objects in the hierarchy and produced this table.

Figure 1 - A Hierachy of Programming Architectures
Traditional languages, like C, address the procedural level. Object-oriented
languages, like C++ and Java, address the object-oriented level.
Multi-threading, multi-processing and distributed architectures are not
directly supported by general purpose programming languages(1). That is
provided by operating systems and libraries. Perhaps it is time to think about
adding these facilities to the C++ Standard Library.
Support for Threads in the Standard Library
Since then I have been prompted to consider multi-threading support for
other reasons, too. Recent articles in Overload [1], [2] and the C/C++ Users
Journal [3] have described designs that differ from those I&#146;ve seen
before. There are also unresolved issues in projects at work related to the use
of threads in object-oriented designs.
So, I set myself the task of exploring current ideas and trying to design
thread support facilities suitable for inclusion in the standard library. I am
aware that this topic has been considered by a number of people more
knowledgeable and more able than myself. And I believe that threads were
omitted from the standard library partly because existing threading models
differ too much for a &#145;standard&#146; solution to be accepted. The aim was
not so much to define an extension to the standard, but more to learn about the
strengths and weaknesses of different approaches while remaining focused on the
essentials.
Survey of Existing Multi-Threading Facilities
I looked at a number of software packages providing threads. They are listed
in Table 1.

Table 1 - A Selection of Thread packages.
The packages fall into three main categories: operating system kernel API,
general-purpose C++ interface and vendor-specific interface. In Java the
distinction between operating system and language is blurred, so that has been
given a category of its own.
Most of the packages listed here have been studied only superficially. The
kernel APIs provide the low-level facilities that might be used to implement
C++ classes. They were examined to see what building blocks are readily
available. Each of the vendor-specific C++ interfaces depends on facilities not
directly related to the provision of multi-threading (e.g. Window objects). I
regarded these extra facilities as inessential and inappropriate to a standard
library. The Java and general-purpose C++ interface packages have much in
common and I concentrated on these. It is worth noting, however, that the
vendor-specific packages, when stripped of extraneous features, also have much
in common with the Java and general-purpose groups.
Core Facilities
I will call the features common to most/all of the general-purpose
interfaces (including Java) the core facilities. 
Table 2 lists the core facilities together with the corresponding Win32 API
functions by way of example. These features define the thread model that will
be discussed in this article.

Table 2 - Summary of Core Facilities.
In considering these facilities it is important to distinguish between a
thread and the function it is executing. A thread is a resource provided by the
system; a thread function is a user-defined piece of code.
Other facilities provided by existing implementations include things like:
names for threads (useful for diagnostics), access control (does the user have
permission to create a thread, change its priority, etc.), ordering relations
(operatorprinter;
 std::string* file_name = args->file_name;
 printer->print(*file_name);
 return 0;
}
The new print function can be run in a separate thread like this:
Epson_Stylus printer;
std::string file_name("printer_test.txt");
print_args args = {&printer, &file_name};
thread print_thread(print_function,&args);
Using Thread-Runs-Polymorphic-Object we must create a concrete thread
function class:
// concrete thread function class
class print_function : public thread::function
{
public:
 print_function (Printer& p, std::string n)
 : printer(p), file_name(n)
 {}
private:
 virtual int run()
 {
 printer.print(file_name);
 return 0;
 }
 Printer& printer;
 std::string file_name;
};
Like the print_args struct in the Thread-Runs-Function design the print
function class holds information about the printer and the file to be printed.
Now, though, the virtual thread function has access to that data via the
implicit this pointer. No cast is necessary and no statements are
required to decode the data structure.
The new thread class can be used like this:
Epson_Stylus printer;
std::string file_name("printer_test.txt");
print_function print_file(printer,file_name);
thread print_thread(print_function);
The quantity of code is similar in both designs, but the object-oriented
style leads to better quality.
Looking Ahead
So far, we have only considered the fundamental mechanism for invoking a
user-defined function in a separate thread. Most of the core facilities
have not been discussed at all and some of them raise further design issues.
There is one problem that is common to many of the core facilities; it is the
age old problem of how to balance the need for a simple, consistent interface
with the desire to make available the full power of each underlying
implementation.
As an example of what I mean, a VGA interface can be provided for just about
any video card and this is fine for some applications. But many applications
need more advanced graphical operations. Of course there are plenty of video
cards to choose from, but they differ in capabilities and native interface. How
can we write a portable graphics library that takes advantage of the particular
features of each card? Threads present us with several examples of this sort of
dilemma and I would like to explore these in the next article.
Then, beyond the basic thread facilities there are issues of ownership and
synchronisation. In each of the thread designs presented in this article a
parent thread function provides some data to the child. Sometimes
responsibility for those data items remains with the parent, sometimes it is
passed on to the child. Similarly, a responsible parent will clean up after a
child thread dies, but some parents will die themselves, leaving their children
orphaned. I suggest these issues are best addressed by a more
application-oriented threading model and there is scope for another article
here.
Summary
This article has described three common approaches to basic thread
facilities and discussed their suitability for inclusion in a standard library.
The Thread-Runs-Polymorphic-Object model fits well with object-oriented
designs and separates the thread support facilities from the
application-specific code.
Providing access to platform-specific facilities and the use of
application-oriented thread models were raised as topics for further
discussion.
