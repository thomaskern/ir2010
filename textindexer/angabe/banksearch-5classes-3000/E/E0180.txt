Compiling the IJG JPEG library with BC55
The Independent JPEG Group (IJG) provides a free and open source code library for
compressing and decompressing JPEG images. The library is written in C, and is
designed to be portable between many compilers and platforms.
The IJG library is designed to be compiled from the command line with make. The
library includes several makefiles for various compilers and platforms, although
it does not provide a makefile for BC55, the free C++ command line compiler
from Borland. The purpose of this article is to provide a makefile that will
work with BC55, to list what changes have to be made in order to compile the
JPEG source code, and to provide an example program that shows how to link with
the JPEG library once you have compiled it.
Before you get started with the IJG JPEG library, you need to download the
source. You can download the IJG library from
here.
Extract the contents of the zip file to a convenient location, such as c:\jpeg.
 
Note:
If you use C++Builder, and if you use the pascal based VCL, then I suggest that you rely on the TJPEGImage class to handle
JPEG images in your programs. It is easier to use than working with the JPEG library directly. TJPEGImage is actually a wrapper
for the free IJG JPEG library. See the faq on JPEG images for an example of how to use
TJPEGImage.
On the other hand, you should use the IJG JPEG library if you are using the free
command line compiler from Borland instead of using C++Builder. You might also
want to use the IJG library if you are writing a pure C/C++ app, or if you need
the added flexibility that the IJG library affords.

Introduction to the IJG library
When you unzip the JPEG library, you should see a host of C files, header files, sample makefiles, and some DOC files. Before you attempt
to use the library, you should browse through the DOC files, especially libjpeg.doc. These DOC files explain how the JPEG library
is structured, and how you perform a compression or decompression step. I am not going to cover how the library works,
because the DOC files already explain that, and they explain it better than I could. Instead, I am going to discuss how to compile the
library, and specifically, how to compile the library with BC55. For more information on JPEG compression principles, visit the following
FAQs and websites:

The JPEG library makefile
The JPEG library contains makefiles for several compilers and platforms. The makefiles are named using the format makefile.XXX
where XXX is the platform that you are targeting. Some of the names include makefile.ansi, makefile.unix,
makefile.vc, and makefile.bcc. Two of the more interesting ones are makefile.ansi and makefile.bcc.
makefile.bcc works with older versions of Borland C++ for DOS and OS/2. Despite the fact that the makefile is for an older
version of Borland C++, it still serves as a good starting ground for BC55. makefile.ansi is a generic makefile that serves as a
good starting point for almost any platform.
Using the older makefile.bcc as a starting point, I have created a makefile called makefile.bc55 that works with the
free BC55 C++ compiler from Borland. You can download the makefile here.
The makefile for the JPEG library does several things. It compiles the JPEG source code into a library called libjpeg.lib (or
libjpeg.a depending on your OS and compiler). The makefile also compiles a compression example and a decompression example.
These examples link with the JPEG library that was built from the source. Lastly, the makefile also contains targets for cleaning up
intermediate files and for running the example programs.
Let's take a quick look at some of these targets in the makefile:
all: libjpeg.lib cjpeg.exe djpeg.exe jpegtran.exe wrjpgcom.exe rdjpgcom.exe
libjpeg.lib: $(LIBOBJECTS)
cjpeg.exe: $(COBJECTS) $(JPEGLIB)
djpeg.exe: $(DOBJECTS) $(JPEGLIB)
jpegtran.exe: $(TROBJECTS) $(JPEGLIB)
rdjpgcom.exe: rdjpgcom.c
wrjpgcom.exe: wrjpgcom.c
jconfig.h: jconfig.doc jconfig.bc55
clean:
test: cjpeg.exe djpeg.exe jpegtran.exe
The all target specifies what happens by default when you do a make. The default targets are the JPEG static library
(libjpeg.lib), the compression and decompression examples (cjpeg.exe and djpeg.exe), and the utility programs.
The clean target deletes intermediate files, such as OBJs, and the test target exercises cjpeg.exe and
djpeg.exe.
 
Note:
Beware that the clean target also deletes the LIB file and the sample EXEs. If you only want the clean
target to delete OBJs, then you will need to edit the makefile.
 
The jconfig.h target is an interesting item. jconfig.h is an important header file for the JPEG library. It determines
various platform specific issues. This header file helps the JPEG library achieve its cross platform status. To support various
platforms, the JPEG library provides several versions of jconfig.h (jconfig.mac, jconfig.vc,
jconfig.bcc, etc). The makefile actually determines which configuration to use by copying the correct jconfig.xxx file
to jconfig.h. In order to support BC55, we have to supply a BC55 friendly version of jconfig.h. We'll look at this in
the next step.
That's all I'm going to say about the JPEG library makefile for BC55. You may want to sift through the makefile that I provide,
makefile.bc55, to learn more about how it works.
Changing the IJG source code so it will compile with BC55
For the most part, the JPEG source compiles fine with BC55. However, you do need to change two header files in order to compile the
library cleanly. The two files are jpeglib.h, and jmorecfg.h. You also need to provide a BC55 friendly version of
jconfig.h. You can download the modified files here
(along with the makefile).
The changes to jpeglib.h and jmorecfg.h are listed below. If you don't understand what these changes are doing, don't
worry about it. As long as you use the modified header files from my FTP site,
you will be fine.
/******************* Changes to jpeglib.h **************************/
#ifndef JPEGLIB_H
#define JPEGLIB_H
/* HJH modification: added extern "C" { when __cplusplus detected */
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
...
/* near bottom of the file */
/* HJH modification: add closing } for extern "C" { */
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
#endif /* JPEGLIB_H */
/******************* Changes to jmorecfg.h **************************/
/* jmorecfg.h line 160 */
/* X11/xmd.h correctly defines INT32 */
/* HJH modification: jmorecfg.h already contained a test for XMD_H and xmd.h
 My change adds a test for _BASETSD_H_ because the windows header file
 basestd.h already defines INT32 */
#if !defined(XMD_H) && !defined(_BASETSD_H_)
typedef long INT32;
#endif
/* jmorecfg.h line 220 */
/* HJH modification: several of the windows header files already define FAR
 because of this, the code below was changed so that it only tinkers with
 the FAR define if FAR is still undefined */
#ifndef FAR
 #ifdef NEED_FAR_POINTERS
 #define FAR far
 #else
 #define FAR
 #endif
#endif
The first change was to jpeglib.h. This is the main header file that client programs include in order
to use the library. The change is to add an extern "C" wrapper around the entire header file. The reason for doing this is
that the JPEG library is written in C, but you may want to use the library from a C++ file. Without the extern "C", you might
see unresolved external linker errors when trying to make JPEG calls from a C++ file.
The second change is to jmorecfg.h. This header file plays a crucial role in making the JPEG library cross platform. I had to
make two changes to jmorecfg.h, and both were because the Windows header files from Microsoft already declare a type or a define
that jmorecfg.h also defines. My modifications prevent jmorecfg.h from clashing with the Microsoft headers.
The last file that you have to modify is jconfig.h. Actually, you don't modify jconfig.h, rather, you provide a BC55
compatible version of jconfig.h called jconfig.bc55. To create a BC55 compatible version of jconfig.h, I
started with jconfig.bcc, which is tailored with Borland C++ for DOS in mind. This file works as is, except for the
following addition that I had to make:
/* HJH Note: Here is one key addition that I had to make. The jpeg library uses
 * a type called boolean. It defines boolean here. However, RPCNDR.H
 * yet another Microsoft header, also defines boolean. The ifndef
 * ensures that we don't attempt to redefine boolean if rpcndr.h has
 * already defined it. Note that we use unsigned char instead of int
 * like jmorecfg.h does, because we want to match what's in the SDK
 * header. See jconfig.vc for more info, it does the same thing. */
#ifndef __RPCNDR_H__	/* don't conflict if rpcndr.h already read */
typedef unsigned char boolean;
#endif
#define HAVE_BOOLEAN	/* prevent jmorecfg.h from redefining it */
The JPEG library defines and uses a type called boolean. The typedef occurs in jmorecfg.h. Unfortunately, one
of the Microsoft headers, rpcndr.h, also defines the boolean type. Furthermore, the Microsoft headers define
boolean differently than the JPEG library defines it. My solution was to make sure that we define boolean the same way
that the Microsoft header does, and we only define it if the Microsoft header has not already done so. Next, we define the
HAVE_BOOLEAN constant, which tells jmorecfg.h not to define the boolean type.
 
Note:
I discovered this issue regarding rpcndr.h and boolean from the configuration file for Microsoft Visual C++,
jconfig.vc. MSVC and Borland C++ provide essentially the same set of Microsoft SDK header files. Users of MSVC suffer from the
same typedef clashes that Borland C++ users suffer from.
 
Those are the only source code changes that have to be made in order to compile the JPEG library. Its nice to see that we don't have to
muck around in the C files in order to get the library to compile. Although it is disheartening when you consider that most of our
changes were to work around type clashes with the Microsoft header files.
Compiling the JPEG library
To compile the JPEG library, simply download makefile.bc55 and the
changes to the JPEG header files, unzip them over the existing files from the JPEG library, and run make.exe from the command
line. Make sure that you pass it the BC55 compatible makefile, makefile.bc55.
 > make -f makefile.bc55
Don't forget the -f switch. It tells make the name of your makefile. Some people forget the -f switch, and do this:
 // Error!!!!!
 > make makefile.bc55
When you build the project, you should get a LIB file called libjpeg.lib, and some EXEs. The JPEG makefile is designed to
create both the library and the example programs. The two main example programs are cjpeg.exe, for compression, and
djpeg.exe for decompression. The makefile also has a clean target that will erase OBJs and other intermediate files.
This target is not called by default, you must explicitly invoke it. There is also a target for running the example programs.
 > make -f makefile.bc55 clean
 > make -f makefile.bc55 test
Beware of what the clean target actually does! It deletes the LIB files, and the sample programs, as well as the executables. You might
want to edit the makefile if you do not like this behavior.
The default makefiles from the IJG assume that you want to build the jpeg library in release mode. This makes sense. However, you may
want to build a debug library if you will need to debug into the JPEG source code. The makefile that I produced allows you to build a
debug library as well as a release library. To build the debug library, define DEBUG using the -D switch when you
invoke make.
 > make -B -f makefile.bc55 -DDEBUG
The extra -B switch ensures that all C files are rebuilt. If there are release OBJs lying around, make won't rebuild
them just because you define DEBUG. You don't want any release OBJs making it into your debug JPEG library.
When you define DEBUG, make will produce a LIB file with a different name, jpegd.lib. I decided that the debug library
should have a different name then the release library. If you don't like this practice, or if you don't like the filename that I chose,
then you can alter the makefile. The library filename is stored in the JPEGLIB macro.
Of course, you don't need to bother with a debug library just to step into the JPEG source when debugging. Another easy way to debug
the JPEG source is to simply add the JPEG source files to your project and compile them straight in. Your projects won't compile as
quickly as they would if you used the LIB file, but the JPEG files compile pretty fast anyway, so its not much of an issue.
Using the compiled JPEG library in a project
Once you have built the JPEG library, you should not need to compile the JPEG source after that. When you need to use the JPEG
library, just link with the LIB file (libjpeg.lib or jpegd.lib). When you compile, tell the compiler where the JPEG
header files are by using the -I switch.
To demonstrate how to do this, I have put together a simple example project. This project creates a JPEG from a 24 bit RGB test pattern.
You can download the example here.
I won't show the source code for this project, as its pretty boring. But I will show the makefile.

There are two points of interest in this makefile. First, notice that I have added the path c:\jpeg\borland to the include path
that gets passed to both the linker and the compiler. This allows the compiler to locate the JPEG header files, and it allows the linker
to locate the JPEG LIB file. You will need to edit the JPEGPATH macro if you installed the JPEG header files to a location other
than c:\jpeg\borland. Second, we have to pass the JPEG lib file to the linker. This is done through the JPEGLIB macro.
Other than these two items, this is a pretty standard makefile.
Notes
Note 1: It is important that you compile your program with the same compiler options that you used to compile the JPEG library.
Specifically, the compiler options for structure alignment (the -a family of options), and enum size (-b) must match. There may be other
options that have to match too. If these compiler options do not match, then your client program and the JPEG library will not agree on how
big the JPEG structures should be. The structures increase or decrease in size depending on the -a and -b switches.
This structure alignment issue can be a major pain. Ideally, you should not be forced to use the same alignment options that the JPEG
library uses. To rectify the problem, you have a couple of choices. First, you could forget about the LIB file altogether, and just compile
the JPEG source files right into your projects. When you do this, you guarantee that the JPEG source is compiled with the same options that
the rest of your project is compiled with.
Another way to solve this problem is to place a #pragma option push statment in jpeglib.h. This is called a compiler
option guard. It ensures that the JPEG source is compiled with a given set of compiler options, and it ensures that clients of the LIB
file know about those compiler options. Here is how you would edit jpeglib.h
#ifndef JPEGLIB_H
#define JPEGLIB_H
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
/* HJH modification: protect compiler options for structure alignment and enum
 * size if the compiler is Borland C++ */
#pragma option push -b
#pragma option push -a1
// ...
// body of file
// ...
#pragma option pop /* pop -a switch */
#pragma option pop /* pop -b */
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
#endif /* JPEGLIB_H */
Keep in mind that you don't have to use -b and -a1. You could use -b- and -a4. It doesn't really matter. The key is to protect the
structures and the enums in the library so they always compile to the same size, regardless of the compiler options in the makefile. The
-a4 might actually result in slightly better performance.
Note 2: If you do place compiler option guards in the JPEG header file, you might want to use a #ifdef __BORLANDC__
statement. This way, the #pragmas only play a role if the compiler is BC55 or Borland C++Builder. You might not want to have these
#pragma's in your code if you need to compile the source with another compiler.
The ANSI C++ standard promises that compilers are supposed to ignore #pragma statements that they don't understand. However,
many compilers will interpret #pragma option push the same way Borland does. But there is a catch. On another compiler, -a and
-b might mean totally different things. For this reason, it makes sense to only compile in the #pragma's if you detect that
the code is being compiled with the Borland compiler. Here is how you would change the header file.
#ifndef JPEGLIB_H
#define JPEGLIB_H
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
/* HJH modification: protect compiler options for structure alignment and enum
 * size if the compiler is Borland C++ */
#ifdef __BORLANDC__
#pragma option push -b
#pragma option push -a1
#endif
// ...
// body of file
// ...
#ifdef __BORLANDC__
#pragma option pop /* pop -a switch */
#pragma option pop /* pop -b */
#endif
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
#endif /* JPEGLIB_H */
Note 3: The jpeglib.h file for BC55 has been updated to
include the #pragma option guards.
Note 4: When you compress an image, you pass rows of image data to the JPEG compressor by calling
jpeg_write_scanlines. Probably the most common way to pass in data is to send the compressor 24-bit RGB data.
There is one important item to watch out for when you are working on the Windows platform. On Windows, the first byte of
a 24-bit RGB pixel is the blue intensity. However, the JPEG library expects the first byte to be the red intensity. Both
Windows and the JPEG library agree that the second byte should be green. But they disagree on the third byte. In a
Windows bitmap the third byte is red, whereas the JPEG library expects the third byte to be blue. In other words, the
JPEG library and Windows have swapped the meaning of the first and third bytes in a 24-bit RGB pixel.
Before we continue, let's clarify some terminology. When I say the first byte should be blue, what I really mean is that
the lowest memory address of the pixel should contain the blue intensity. Let's say that you have a row of image data in
an unsigned char array, like this:
unsigned char buff[640*3]; // a buffer of 24-bit RGB data
Each pixel in the buffer consumes 3 bytes. The first pixel spans across buff[0], buff[1], and
buff[2]. The first byte of the first pixel is buff[0], the byte at the lowest address. In a Windows bitmap,
buff[0] would contain the blue intensity of the first pixel, and buff[2] would contain the red. When
you pass buff to jpeg_write_scanlines, the JPEG library expects these two bytes to be reversed. buff[0]
should contain the red intensity, and buff[2] should contain the blue.
This fact is incredibly easy to miss. If you forget to take this into account, your images will compress just fine, but
the resulting JPEG will not look right. On some real world images, it can be difficult to notice the difference,
especially if the image contains a lot of green. On other images, the problem stands out more clearly (ie a blue car
would suddenly become red when compressed into a JPEG).
There are a couple ways to deal with this problem. First, you can loop through your 24-bit RGB bitmap data and swap the
red and the blue bytes before passing the data to the JPEG compressor. Make sure that you do this in an offscreen
buffer, and that you don't paint the bitmap on the screen (it won't look right because you just messed up every pixel in
the bitmap). You must also perform this reversal if you decompress a JPEG in your program. The red and blue pixels
coming out of the decompressor should be swapped before you display the RGB data on the screen.
Another option is to modify three defines in jmorecfg.h. The IJG designed the JPEG library to allow you to
specify the ordering of bytes in an RGB pixel. The defines are RGB_RED, RGB_GREEN, and RGB_BLUE.
The default implementation of jmorecfg.h looks like this:
#define RGB_RED	0	/* Offset of Red in an RGB scanline element */
#define RGB_GREEN	1	/* Offset of Green */
#define RGB_BLUE	2	/* Offset of Blue */
To force the JPEG library to treat RGB pixels the same way Windows does, change the defines to:
#define RGB_RED	2	/* Offset of Red in an RGB scanline element */
#define RGB_GREEN	1	/* Offset of Green */
#define RGB_BLUE	0	/* Offset of Blue */
Keep in mind that these indexing problems play a role when you are compressing a 24-bit RGB image into a color JPEG
(YCbCr) or a grayscale JPEG. However, if you are compressing a grayscale image, then you don't have to worry about it.
See jmorecfg.h for more information.
