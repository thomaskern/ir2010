Rich Edit 3.0 Code Samples
Here are samples of Rich Edit 3.0 code that work for me,
 comments about features that do not work as I originally
 expected, errors identified in the MSDN online Rich Edit
 3.0 documentation, Rich Edit 3.0 constants that you will
 need if you do not have new header files, SendMessage()
 parameters, and anything else that I think that you might
 need to know to program for Rich Edit 3.0 controls. 
 This page is definitely a work in progress and I anticipate
 rolling the information on this page into a TRichEdit30
 class. However, if you do not want to wait for me to
 post a TRichEdit30 class, here is what I have learned so
 far. 
 
Before delving into this code, see the
 Rich Edit 3.0
 FAQ to determine if you have the 3.0 version, learn
 where to get it if you do not have it, and see what
 features it has that you may need or find useful. 
 Please be warned that I am finding that some of the
 features that I expected, based on MSDN online documents,
 are not fully implemented or do not function exactly as
 advertised. I will include information about these
 differences where appropriate below. 
 
I would appreciate any information that you work out
 that is not on this page. If possible, please send
 code samples that are constructed as described below to
 minimize the chances for me to introduce errors into your
 code. As always, you will get credit for any code
 that you send. Of course, if you find any errors
 here, please set me straight.

Rich Edit 3.0 Code Samples - Base
Code
Ok. I have a dilemma. The most efficient way
 to develop the Rich Edit 3.0 code is to derive a class from
 the Rich Edit 2.0 class (TRichEdit20) already available on
 this site. So much of the code is identical and so
 many of the Rich Edit 3.0 features are simple extensions of
 the v2.0 functionality. In fact, if you install the
 Rich Edit 3.0 DLL on your system, it replaces the v2.0 DLL
 (riched20.dll) and the TRichEdit20 class automatically
 loads the v3.0 DLL. 
 
On the other hand, I want the code on this page to work
 without requiring you to dig through all of the TRichEdit20
 class code, useful though it may be. So here is
 (today's) decision: The code on this page will be
 based upon the stripped-down TRichEdit20 class code below
 which does nothing more than ensure that a v2.0 or v3.0 DLL
 gets loaded. Note that neither the TRichEdit20 class
 nor the code below actually tests to ensure that the v3.0
 DLL is installed &#150; if v3.0 is installed, it is
 loaded. If not, v2.0 gets loaded if it has been
 installed. (You should get an error if neither is
 installed, but I have not tested for that.) 
 
If you wish to follow my advice to start with the
 TRichEdit20 class, add the following declaration/definition
 to your code and skip the rest of this section: 
 class TRichEdit30 : public TRichEdit20
{
public:
 TRichEdit30(TComponent* Owner) : TRichEdit20(Owner) {};
};
 Otherwise, here is the minimal TRichEdit30 class used
 by the rest of the code on this page. Note that some
 of the member functions are empty. That is, the
 functions are declared/defined, but contain no or almost no
 code. This reflects my experience &#150; although
 empty now, I have a gut feeling that we will need to add
 code to these methods sometime later. Maybe not, but
 I am trying to keep things flexible.... 
 
[ BCB4 users &#150; if you are not using
 the TRichEdit20 class as described above,
 click here
 to download the basic Rich Edit 3.0 project code that
 follows. You should probably read through the
 comments below to ensure that you understand each part of
 the code and, more importantly, what this minimal class
 does not do for you. ] 
 
Here is the minimal TRichEdit30 class used for the
 remainder of this page: 
 
Declarations (inline or in *.hpp file) 
 //---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include 
class TRichEdit30 : public TRichEdit
{
private:
 int FLibHandle;
protected:
 virtual void __fastcall CreateParams(Controls::TCreateParams &Params);
 virtual void __fastcall DestroyWnd(void);
 virtual void __fastcall CreateWnd(void);
 virtual void __fastcall WndProc(Messages::TMessage &Message);
public:
 __fastcall TRichEdit30(TComponent* Owner);
 __fastcall ~TRichEdit30();
 virtual void __fastcall RecreateWnd(void); // not virtual in base!!!
};
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Definitions (inline or in a *.cpp file) 
 //---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// may need to add code here later
//
__fastcall TRichEdit30::TRichEdit30(TComponent* Owner) : TRichEdit(Owner)
{
}
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// may need to add code here later
//
__fastcall TRichEdit30::~TRichEdit30()
{
}
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// may need to add code here later
//
void __fastcall TRichEdit30::CreateWnd(void)
{
 TRichEdit::CreateWnd();
}
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// the following ensures that the riched20.dll (v2.0 or v3.0) is loaded;
// TRichEdit unloads the DLL that *IT* loads in the WM_NCDESTROY handler (which,
// disappointingly enough, is private rather than protected; damned if FLibHandle
// isn't also, or we could simply unload it later) but we do it in DestroyWnd()...
// (note: do not call TRichEdit::CreateParams -- it will attempt to
// load the older version of the rich edit DLL -- not a Good Thing -- too bad
// if anything important goes on there)
//
void __fastcall TRichEdit30::CreateParams(Controls::TCreateParams &Params)
{
 const char RichEditModuleName[] = "RICHED20.DLL";
 long int OldError;
 OldError = SetErrorMode(SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX);
 FLibHandle = (int) LoadLibrary(RichEditModuleName);
 if (FLibHandle Parent = this;
RE30->Align = alClient;
 The following examples will operate on the RE30 global
 variable. 
 
To get started, create a new project, add a main menu,
 and then add the necessary code to declare and define the
 TRichEdit30 class. In the main form, add the
 declaration for RE30 and then add the RE30 initialization
 to the form constructor. Now we are ready to get on
 to the good stuff. 
 
Zooming in and out
Rich Edit 3.0 adds the ability to enlarge (zoom in) or
 shrink (zoom out) the text inside the control. For
 example, you can enlarge all of the text in the control by
 an arbitrary factor and the enlarged text will wrap inside
 the window as if the fonts' sizes had been changed. 
 One would assume, based upon the MSDN information, that the
 printed version of the text would be unchanged from the
 original font size(s). The text scaling definitely
 works (see the comments in the code), but I have not
 confirmed that printing is unaffected. 
 // message constants
#define EM_GETZOOM (WM_USER + 224)
#define EM_SETZOOM (WM_USER + 225)
// the following DWORDs (not WORDs as documented at MSDN) determine the scaling. The ratio of 
// numerator / denominator must be between 1/64th and 64. note that a ratio of less than 1:1
// does not actually display text at less than the unscaled size of the text (that is, you
// cannot scale to less than 100%) in my tests with riched20.dll version 5.30.11.2410. however,
// if you set the scaling to, say, 1:2, then EM_GETZOOM does return 1:2, although the control
// contents are displayed 1:1. OTOH, maybe I do not understand how to use this properly....
//
// to reset the scaling factor to 1:1, set both values to 0.
//
// the following values set the scaling factor to 3 times the normal size.
DWORD numerator = 3;
DWORD denominator = 1;
// EM_SETZOOM returns true on success or false on failure
bool result = ::SendMessage(RE30->Handle, EM_SETZOOM, (WPARAM) numerator, (LPARAM) denominator);
 To get the current zoom factor: 
 // EM_GETZOOM should always return true. note that numerator and denominator may be zero
result = ::SendMessage(RE30->Handle, EM_GETZOOM, (WPARAM) &numerator, (LPARAM) &denominator);
Paragraph numbering
Paragraph numbering is effected through the PARAFORMAT2
 structure and the EM_GETPARAFORMAT and EM_SETPARAFORMAT
 messages. A variety of numbering styles are documented: 
 
1) Number with right parenthesis (wNumberingStyle = 0).
 1. Number with a period (wNumberingStyle = 1).
 (1) Number with right and left parenthesis
(wNumberingStyle = 2).
 1 Number only (wNumberingStyle = 3).
 Supposedly, each of the above can be bitwise-or'd with
 0x8000 to force the number to be displayed as a Roman
 numeral. My tests with the the 5.30.11.2410 version
 of the riched20.dll reveal that all numbering styles
 display as a number followed by a right parenthesis (the
 first item in the list above). 
 
As mentioned above, the PARAFORMAT2 structure is used to
 set the numbering style. This is done through the following
 structure members: 
 
dwMask - Set the following values (bitwise-or them
together) to identify which of the remaining structure
members are valid: PFM_NUMBERING, PFM_NUMBERINGSTART,
PFM_NUMBERINGSTYLE, and PFM_NUMBERINGTAB.
 wNumbering - 0 = no numbering/bullets, PFN_BULLET =
bullet, 2 = Arabic numbers, 3 = lowercase letters, 4 =
uppercase letters, 5 = lowercase Roman numerals, 6 =
uppercase Roman numerals, 7 = sequence of characters
beginning with the Unicode character specified in the
wNumberingStart member.
 wNumberingStart - Starting value for numbering.
Ignored according to MSDN documentation.
 wNumberingStyle - Style for numbering
 wNumberingTab - Minimum space, in twips, between the
border and the paragraph's text.
 Here is the code to set the currently selected
 paragraph(s) style to numbered (note that the text must be
 selected before invoking this code): 
 PARAFORMAT2 pf2;
pf2.cbSize = sizeof(pf2);
pf2.dwMask = PFM_NUMBERING | PFM_NUMBERINGSTART | PFM_NUMBERINGSTYLE;
pf2.wNumbering = 3;
pf2.wNumberingStart = 1;
pf2.wNumberingStyle = 2;
::SendMessage(RE30->Handle, EM_SETPARAFORMAT, 0, (LPARAM) &pf2);
 Try different combinations and see what you get. 
 
Saving and restoring the current
scroll position
Rich Edit includes a frequently requested feature
 notably absent in prior versions. You can now save
 and restore the current vertical and horizontal scroll
 positions accurately and easily. 
 // message constants
#define EM_GETSCROLLPOS (WM_USER + 221)
#define EM_SETSCROLLPOS (WM_USER + 222)
// create a POINT structure to hold the scroll position
POINT pt = { 0, 0 };
// fetch the scroll position into pt
::SendMessage(RE30->Handle, EM_GETSCROLLPOS, 0, (LPARAM) &pt);
[ do a bunch of stuff... ]
// now restore the scroll postion
::SendMessage(RE30->Handle, EM_SETSCROLLPOS, 0, (LPARAM) &pt);
 This is definitely a candidate for the "new
 feature most easy to use" award. It is also a
 candidate for the "why was this feature not in the
 last two versions?" award. 
 
More to come as time, energy, and wife permit...
