Alan Balmer is the 
 owner of Balmer Consulting, and is a veteran of over 20 years of 
 experience in all aspects of computing; from mainframes to microcomputers, 
 from design to debugging. His undergraduate work was 
 in physics and theoretical math, with a minor in chemistry, and 
 he has spent time as a logic circuit designer, electronics engineer 
 and NIR spectroscopy researcher, with an interesting but not 
 habit-forming excursion into management. He has been a member of 
 Team Powersoft, then Team Sybase, since the Compuserve days. His 
 software career began by writing circuit design programs in Fortran 
 and progressed to work on real-time process control operating 
 systems. He is (or has been) reasonably fluent in several 
 assembler languages, C, C++, Perl, Java, FORTRAN, BASIC, PASCAL, 
 and PL/I, and now thinks Python is neat. Al is now based in 
 Phoenix, Arizona, USA, and does a variety of things, from small business 
 consulting to writing device drivers for process 
 control, but spends the majority of his time writing C on Unix 
 systems for a manufacturer of card-based transaction and security 
 systems. Al enjoys writing tools and though interested in everything, 
 will likely concentrate on the Watcom auxiliary programs, 
 leaving the heavy-duty compiler work to younger and smarter 
 colleagues. You can contact Alan via email at 
 alan.balmer@teamsybase.com.

Craig is now a closet developer as he has 
 taken on a CEO role at Action Engine (http://www.actionengine.com). 
 He worked at Watcom from 1989 to 1993, on versions 8.0 through 
 9.5. He was reponsible for developing the Windows extender 
 (win386), the editor, the win16/win32/win386/os2 2 debuggers, the 
 win16/win32 runtime libraries and various and sundry other things 
 before moving to Microsoft in 1993. While at Microsoft, Craig was 
 the founding developer for the DirectX project, and left in 
 January of 2000 after spending almost 2 years as the General 
 Manager of the Windows Media Platform group. Craig is 
 still in Redmond, WA, having a blast doing the startup thing, and 
 among other things is doing programming for the Palm OS where his 
 16 bit, low memory, slow processor experience is finally paying 
 off. After all this time, Craig still secretly wishes he was 
 playing poker with his Watcom buddies again. You can contact Craig 
 at craig@theeislers.com.

Stephen has 
 been programming in C since 1985, C++ since 1996 
 and assembler since sometime in the dark distant past, 
 mostly on Microsoft Operating Systems. Stephen has used every 
 version of Watcom C/C++ since 1987 (version 7.0), and has also 
 used just about every version of Microsoft C, C++ BASIC 
 compilers since 1984. Stephen has been a member of TeamSybase, the 
 official Sybase support team for the Sybase News Server since 
 1996, supporting Watcom C/C++ and more recently Watcom Fortran. 
 Stephen has good knowledge on 16 and 32-bit DOS, 16 and 
 32-bit Windows and as part of he Open Watcom group expects to 
 be looking at the C, C++ and Fortran compilers as well as WASM and 
 the C, C++ and Fortran runtime libraries. Stephen maintains 
 good relationships with the original developers of the Watcom 
 compilers in Waterloo. You can contact Stephen via email at 
 stephenh@openwatcom.org.

Timur Tabi is the world's sexiest 
 OS/2 developer. When he's not modeling men's underwear for 
 Victoria's Secret, he writes OS/2 and Linux device drivers. 
 Timur's list of accomplishments, both with and without his clothes 
 on, are too numerous to include here, but you can get an idea of 
 just how studly he is by visiting his web site at http://www.tabi.org/timur/index.html. As 
 a member of the Open Watcom group, Timur will be concentrating on 
 enhancing the OS/2-specific areas of the compiler, but will probably 
 end up working on whatever catches his fancy at the moment. 
 You can contact Timur via email at timur@tabi.org.

Jason Quijano is a Chico State 
 Computer Science student learning how to be a "real” programmer from 
 Kendall. ( see above ) . Jason likes to read Willam S. Burroughs, Jack 
 Kerouac and Alen Ginsberg. He recalls Burroughs saying , "I have an 
 exercise I learned from a Mafia Don in Ohio: see everybody on the street 
 before they see you. It's quite interesting actually because, if you see 
 everyone before they see you, they won't see you. And then you'll find 
 that somebody beat you." You can contact Jason via email at

Yes! As part of the process of preparing the source code for release under an Open Source license, SciTech Software and a select group of external developers will create and distribute a binary patch upgrade release (11.0c) on the Open Watcom web site. This binary patch will be available free of charge to existing Watcom C/C++ and Fortran customers and will include all updates and bug fixes developed by Sybase since the last commercial update of the product (11.0b).

No. The commercial versions of the Watcom C/C++ and Fortran compilers contained licensed copies of the Windows SDK, Microsoft Foundation Classes, OS/2 Toolkit and other commercial tools. Due to licensing issues, those components cannot be made freely available. Hence in order to utilise the 11.0c binary patch release, you will need an official copy of the 11.0, 11.0a or 11.0b installation CD.

Preparing such a large project for its Open Source debut will take several months, so initially SciTech Software and a select group of external developers will be working to prepare the source code for release under an Open Source license. Once the source code has been prepared for release, the complete source to the Open Watcom products will be released on this web site. We hope that the Open Source 1.0 compiler release will be ready sometime near the end of the third quarter of 2001.

Open Watcom FAQ : General Questions :
What compilers will I need to compile the source code? 
[Answer Title and Options][Edit Answer Permissions] 
[Duplicate Answer][Move Answer][Trash Answer][Convert to Category] 
[Insert Text Here][Insert Uploaded Text Here] 
Initially the Open Watcom 1.0 compiler will require an official copy of the Watcom C/C++ 11.0b compiler, with the 11.0c binary patch release applied in order to successfully compile it. This is due to the need to rely upon proprietry SDK's for platforms such as Windows, and OS/2 that cannot be distributed along with the Open Source 1.0 compiler release. It is planned to eliminate this dependency in the Open Source 2.0 release, by allowing the compiler to work with freely downloadable SDK's for the supported platforms.

Open Watcom products will be available free of charge. 
 If you need to use Watcom products prior to the Open Source release, 
 you can purchase previous versions. Sybase Watcom C/C++ and Fortran 
 products have been discontinued, but you still may be able to find 
 them for sale at various places on the Internet. Here are some places 
 to start:

 http://www.greymatter.com
 
 Greymatter have supplies of Watcom C/C++ 11.0b and Watcom Fortran
 11.0b. They will _ONLY_ upgrade original 11.0 and 11.0a owners, so do not
 bother phoning them if you have 10.6 or earlier, it is a waste of time. 
 Do not email, just phone.

[Answer Title and Options][Edit Answer Permissions]

[Insert Text Here][Insert Uploaded Text Here] 
The Watcom compiler has a number of advantages of other free compilers, such as full support for 16-bit DOS and Windows development, powerful commercial level debugger with full remote debugging capabilities (serial, parallel, NetBIOS, TCP/IP etc). The Watcom compiler has always been known as producing some of the fastest code around, and even today the Watcom C/C++ 11.0b product produces code as good as the best comercial compilers available. The Watcom C/C++ compiler is also the only freely available compiler for 16-bit Windows and OS/2 device driver development.

Until the Open Watcom 1.0 compiler release is ready, all development will be closed due to proprietary source code licensing issues. Until the Open Watcom 1.0 source code is ready for release, we are not accepting any new members on the Open Watcom development team.
