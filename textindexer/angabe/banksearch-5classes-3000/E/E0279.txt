TaeRichEdit
Component Information
Open Beta Test
After two years of trying to work
with the Borland VCL TRichEdit class, I finally gave up. There
were too many obstacles that Delphi could easily overcome but BCB
could not -- mostly because Delphi
does not honor the strict object-oriented rules that C++ imposes. 
I will not bore you with the details since they would require at
least a page or two to describe. I will, however, tell you what
is available in this new component....
The TaeRichEdit Component is a set of
roughly twenty classes designed to replace the TRichEdit component. 
The main component class, TTaeRichEdit, completely mimics the VCL
TRichEdit class and adds support for Rich Edit 2.0 and 3.0. 
Unlike similar components, it is derived from neither TRichEdit nor
TCustomRichEdit. Instead, the component is derived directly
from the VCL TCustomMemo class (as is the VCL TRichEdit component)
and written entirely in BCB C++.

TaeRichEdit
Component Features
The TaeRichEdit Component:
	
- 
Completely replaces the Delphi
	Pascal TRichEdit class and is entirely BCB C++ source (except for a
	bit of well-commented assembler).
	
- 
Supports Rich Edit versions 2.0
	and 3.0. New classes are included to support Rich Edit 2.0/3.0
	font characteristics and paragraph formatting as well as automatic
	URL recognition, multi-level undo and redo capabilities, and a host
	of other new features.
	
- 
Provides OLE support by default. This means that users
	can paste bitmaps and other objects directly into the control, view
	and print the bitmaps and objects as they should be displayed or
	printed, and edit the objects using the program that created them.
	
- 
Makes previewing and printing the contents of the control
	easy using default print, preview, print abort dialogs and windows. 
	If you need to change them, the dialogs and windows are easily
	changed (hey, the source code is included). But you should not
	really need to modify the source code since events are provided to
	trap before-page, after-page, before-print-job, and after-print-job
	control. Using these events, you should be able to modify the
	rendered output easily.
	
- 
Includes page headers and footers with substitutable values. 
	That is, you can easily specify headers and footers that print the
	current page number, the number of pages in the document, the
	document file creation and/or modification dates, the document file
	size, the document file name, etc. New properties are included
	to make setting the values a cinch.
	
- 
Provides properties for setting margins and drawing borders
	around headers, footers, and body text. You can specify which
	borders are drawn (left, top, right, bottom) for each of the
	sections (header, footer, and body) and the width of the margins and
	lines.
	
- 
Includes support classes to simplify saving/retrieving
	information to/from the Registry and to simplify getting file
	information (the creation date, long file name, short file name,
	etc.). There are even functions to test whether a file is
	probably simple text, RTF, or binary so that you can open the file
	in the best format.
	
- 
Includes a Page Setup Dialog component to allow users to set
	page margins and orientation.

The TaeRichEdit To Do List
Naturally, there are a few things in
my "to-do" list:
	
- 
Create a TaeRichEdit FAQs page to
	answer common questions, a Bugs page to list problems and
	work-arounds, and a Programs page to link to sites with programs
	that use the component. (Please see also below.)
	
- 
Extend the OLE support to provide
	in-place activation of objects. (The current implementation
	opens the server program in a separate window when the object is
	opened for editing.) I could use some help here. Any
	volunteers?
	
- 
I have already been asked if
	there will be a database version of the TaeRichEdit Component. 
	I am only beginning to think about it but, yeah, it should not be
	too hard. But it will have to wait until we find out how many
	bugs are in the current version. (Note: Other
	programmers have contributed database extensions that are included
	in the distribution file.)
	
- 
Improve the documentation. It is currently rather
	sparse and requires reading a lot of source code to use effectively.
	
- 
Modify the component to support BCB5. 
	Done!
Finally, I fully expect that a few bugs will be discovered and
these become a top priority.
The TaeRichEdit Component Vision
If you read the TaeRichEdit Component license agreement (and you
should), you might think that I am trying to get rich with this
component. Not bloody likely, in my opinion. I have no
delusions that this component will make me rich, solve world hunger,
or supplant the basic mousetrap. Instead, I would prefer that
the TaeRichEdit Component become an "open source" effort. 
To get there, I need your help. Ultimately, I would like to:
	
- 
Write an "open source" version of the Rich Edit
	control. This is not as far-fetched as it sounds. To
	develop the TaeRichEdit Component, I translated the Delphi Pascal
	VCL TRichEdit, TRichEditStrings, TFont, TConsistentAttributes,
	TCharAttributes, and TParaAttributes classes to Borland C++
	Builder. We *can* reproduce the Rich Edit control in open
	source, but we *must* do it before HTML (or some other technology)
	renders the Rich Edit control obsolete.
	
- 
Develop an "open source" C/C++ replacement for the
	Borland Delphi VCL. Ok, this is a bit more far-fetched. 
	Or maybe not. Hey, I translated and enhanced the TRichEdit
	component (and the aforementioned related classes) in about a
	month.. If enough of us get motivated, we could replace the
	Delphi VCL in a matter of months.
	
- 
Have a team of experts to answer Rich Edit control or
	TaeRichEdit Component questions. To this end, I plan to create
	an "Experts Page" that lists sites or e-mail addresses of
	those that contribute and/or are willing to answer Rich Edit and
	TaeRichEdit Component questions. If you think that you might
	be able to help others solve problems with the component, please let
	me know.
Clearly, this vision is a group effort. If enough of us get
behind this, it can happen. Let me know if you are interested.
Download The
TaeRichEdit Component
Please see the TaeRichEdit Component Bugs page for current information about bugs, fixes,
and enhancements.
Note: To get the most out of this component, you will need
the Rich Edit 2.0 or 3.0 DLL (riched20.dll, both versions). 
This package does not include them because Microsoft told me "no"
when I asked to distribute Rich Edit 2.0. See other pages on
this site for locations where you might find the DLL.

For the truly brave, or truly desperate, here are fixes for

other changes. See the TaeRichEdit Component Bugs page for details. Be sure to read the
documentation files before installing the changes, especially if you
are using BCB4.
