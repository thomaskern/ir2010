List of Recommended Books
ANSI & ISO Standard C
by P J Plauger & Jim Brodie
[Highly Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 Even at the higher price it is
an excellent purchase and belongs on every C programmers bookshelf.
Advanced C Struct Programming
by John W.L. Ogilvie
[Highly Recommended]

 Buy this book, set aside a regular time to
work at it, stick to your routine and find yourself becoming far more
professional in your programming.
Advanced C Tips and Techniques

 If you are looking for a book with a different approach to C, compatible
with DOS, UNIX and OS/2 then this one can be highly recommended.
Best C/C++ Tips Ever, The
by Anthony Porter
[Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 This is a book that needs to be worked at if real benefit is to be gained,
but it is worth the money if you have the will to invest the time.
Book on C 4ed, A
by Al Kelley & Ira Pohl
[Recommended]
Sean Reynolds writes:
you are given a thorough grounding in ANSI C within a single and not too weighty, volume.
C Book: Featuring the ANSI C Standard (Second Edition), The

programming and the Standard Libraries to any member of the target

debugging sessions.
C Interfaces and Implementations
by David Hanson
[Highly Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 I would encourage serious C programmers to study this book (that means
reading and re-reading until understanding occurs). In the short term it is
easy to claim that you do not have time to make this kind of effort. In the
long term you do not have time not to.
C Pointers and Dynamic Memory Management
by Michael Daconta
[Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 Work through this book and become a better C programmer.
C Puzzle Book, The

it.

C++ and C Efficiency
by David Spuler
[Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 If you have ambitions to being a craftsman rather than just someone who
knocks up a solution then this is a book that you should read and pass on.
C/C++ Software Quality Tools
by Mark Murphy
[Recommended]
Chris Hills writes:
 This book should be required reading for software engineering students. Many
working programmers would also benefit and experienced software engineers
should be using these tools and methods already. It is unfortunate that many
do not.

by John Q Walker II & Peter Schwaller
[Recommended]
Mike Woolley writes:
 In conclusion, if you're programming APPC buy this book.
CWEB System of Structured Documentation, The
by Knuth & Levy
[Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 This book must be about the shortest ever published - the main text is
slightly under 11 quarto pages...

by David Spuler
[Recommended]
Tony Sumner writes:
 ...but my overall view is that this is an excellent book and well
worth the money.

by Mark Allen Weiss
[Recommended]

 I would recommend this book to anyone who has begun programming in C and
wants to get some solid guidance in how to use it to produce reliable,
effective code.
Efficient C
by Thomas Plum & Jim Brodie
[Recommended]
Ian Cargill writes:
 I can strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to
fine tune their code.
Enough Rope to Shoot Yourself in the Foot
by Allen I Holub
[Highly Recommended]

 From time to time he had me bouncing up and down with fury shouting 'idiot,
you cannot do it like that' but at other times I found myself purring to find
someone who agreed with me.
Expert C Programming, Deep C Secrets
by Peter van der Linden
[Highly Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 I think that
both these books are ones that you should make the effort to get and read.
If I were your manager I would not accept any excuses.
Illustrated C
by Leor Zolman
[Recommended]
Ian Cargill writes:
 The code presented is of a uniformly high quality, and can be taken as a
good example to follow.
Illustrating C (revised)
by Donald Alcocok
[Recommended]
Hao Chik writes:

suitable background in computing and mathematics then this is an excellent
book for you.
More Programming Pearls, Confessions of a Coder
by Jon Bentley
[Highly Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 If you are serious about your programming you should make an opportunity to
read this book and then give it to someone else.

by Jon Bentley
[Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 If you have any pretensions to being a
serious programmer you will have well thumbed copies of both this book and
its companion somewhere in your work space.
No Bugs, Delivering Error Free Code in C and C++
by David Thielen
[Highly Recommended]
Ian Cargill writes:
 I cannot recommend this book too highly. Go out and buy
a copy NOW, it is worth every penny of the price.

by Don Libes
[Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:

the firms over serious C programmer.
Pointers on C
by Kenneth Reek
[Highly Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 Let me stick my neck out and declare that this is the best introductory
text on C programming that I have seen.
The author understands the needs
of his readership and lays an excellent foundation.
Programming Abstractions in C
by Eric S. Roberts
[Recommended]
Mark Batty writes:
 In summary I feel many programmers/engineers who have restricted
algorithm/abstraction knowledge would learn a great deal from this
book.
Safer C
by Les Hatton
[Recommended]
Francis Glassborow writes:
 If you aspire to writing robust code this is a book that you must read (even
if the publishers cannot spell my name correctly).
Serial Communications in C and C++
by Mark Goodwin
[Recommended]
unknown writes:
 This aside, it is a very good book for the
sadist wishing to play with communications on the PC.
Software Solutions in C
by Dale Schumacher
[Highly Recommended]
Ian Cargill writes:
 While there is a surfeit of C books for beginners, there are all too
few books which show the intermediate programmer how to use C to solve
practical problems. Software Solutions in C is an excellent book which does
just that.
Writing Efficient Programs
by Jon Bentley
[Highly Recommended]
Jon Jagger writes:
 Get it. Read it.
