Type-safe TList Objects.
The VCL contains a class called TList that provides an easy way to maintain a list of pointers. Unfortunately,
TList has a handful of serious shortcomings. The most serious shortcoming is the lack of type safety.
This article demonstrates a type-safe derivative of TList. The derived class addresses some of the
defincicies of TList by providing type safety and automatic deletion of the objects contained in the list.

The problem with TList
TList is a handy class for storing a list of pointers to objects, but the class has some problems. The main
problem with TList is that the class is not type-safe. TList maintains the list as a set of void
pointers. Take a look at the prototype for the Add method of TList in CLASSES.HPP. It looks
something like this:
int __fastcall Add(void * Item);
The compiler can implicitly convert any pointer to a void pointer. As a result, the Add function will accept
any pointer that you pass it. This presents a problem when you want to maintain a list of objects that are the same
type. The following code example illustrates the problem. Imagine that you want to maintain a list of TButton
pointers. TList can handle the job, but it doesn't perform any type checking to ensure that only button
objects are added to the list.
TList *ButtonList = new TList; // create a list of buttons
ButtonList->Add(Button1); // add some buttons to the list
ButtonList->Add(Button2); //
ButtonList->Add( new TButton(this)); // OK so far
ButtonList->Add(Application); // Application is not a button
ButtonList->Add(Form1); // neither is Form1
ButtonList->Add((void *)534);
ButtonList->Add(Screen);
The code example above compiles and runs without a hitch. TList does nothing to enforce what types of objects
are added to the list. Any pointer type will be accepted.
The type safety issue becomes more serious when you start dereferencing the objects in the list. Because the list
contains void pointers, you must cast the elements from the list to their proper types. The code example below
shows how that is typically done:
TList *ButtonList = new TList;
ButtonList->Add(Button1);
ButtonList->Add(Button2);
ButtonList->Add(Application);
TButton *button = reinterpret_cast(ButtonList->Items[1]);
button->>Caption = "I hope it's really a button";
delete ButtonList;
The Items array property of TList returns a void pointer. If you are trying to maintain a list of
TButton pointers, then a value from the Items array will need to be cast to a TButton
pointer. This presents a problem. You must assume that the returned item is a button. There is no way to ask the object
if it really is a button. You may be inclined to use the type safe dynamic_cast operator to perform the cast.
Unfortunately, that won't work. Void pointers don't maintain any type information, which means that you can't use
dynamic_cast to cast a void pointer. The compiler won't allow you to.
Since dynamic_cast can't be used, the only way to convert the void pointer is to use reinterpret_cast.
Unfortunately, reinterpret_cast is no different than the old C style of casting. reinterpret_cast never
fails, which allows you cast a pointer to any other type of pointer. As a result, you have no way of knowing if the
item from the list is really the type of object you expect it to be. In the previous code segment, we took the second
button in the list and changed its Caption property. What if we tried to do that with the third item in the
list, which isn't really a TButton object? The code would still work, but instead of changing the caption of
a button, the caption of the program's taskbar icon would change.
Another problem with TList is that it doesn't automatically delete the pointers that are contained in the list.
This is a feature that would sometimes come in handy. In order to properly clean up the list, it is necessary to loop
through the list and delete each object. Here is some code that attempts to deallocate the pointers:
TList *ButtonList = new TList; // create a list of buttons
ButtonList->Add(new TButton(Handle)); // add some buttons to the list
ButtonList->Add(new TButton(Handle));
ButtonList->Add(new TButton(Handle));
ButtonList->Add(new TButton(Handle));
...
...
int nCount = ButtonList->Count;
for (int j=0; jItems[j];
delete ButtonList;
On the surface, this code seems just fine. But dig a little deeper and you will find a sinistair flaw. Focus on the
line that deletes an item from the list. Since Items[j] returns a void pointer, the delete statement
deletes a void pointer. Deleting a void pointer is vastly different than deleting a TButton pointer.
Deleting a void pointer does not execute the objects destructor. As a result, any deallocation that the class does in
its destructor will not occur, which causes a memory leak.
In order to properly delete objects from the list, you must cast them so the compiler knows that it should call the
destructor of the class. Since all destructors in the VCL are virtual, you can survive by casting the items to a common
base. For example, if the list contains buttons and combo boxes, you can delete the items by casting them to a
TComponent, TControl, or TWinControl. Here is a code example:
TList *ControlList = new TList;
ControlList->Add(new TButton(Handle));
ControlList->Add(new TEdit(Handle));
ControlList->Add(new TComboBox(Handle));
int nCount = ControlList->Count;
for (int j=0; j(ControlList->Items[j]);
delete ControlList;
This code will properly delete any object in the list that is derived from TWinControl, but what happens if
someone sneaks a TDataSet pointer into the list? TDataSet is not derived from TWinControl.
The code will delete the dataset by calling the destructor of TWinControl. This will certainly cause run time
havoc.
Lastly, TList could make life easy if it provided an option for automatically deleting the pointers in the
list when we delete the list itself. But, since TList internally maintains a list of void pointers, we now know that
it couldn't delete the objects properly anyway.
An improved list class
The problems outlined in the previous section demonstrate the need for an improved TList. If TList
knew what types of objects it was dealing with, most of its problems would disappear. The code listing below provides a
new class that solves many of the problems introduced by TList. The class is a template class derived from
TList. The code works by providing a type safe layer around the existing methods of TList. These
type safe wrappers allow the compiler to enforce type safety at compile time. The class also provides an option for
automatically deleting the pointers in the list when the list itself is deleted.
//--------------------------------------------------------------
#ifndef TTYPEDLIST_H
#define TTYPEDLIST_H
#include 
template 
class TTypedList : public TList
{
private:
 bool bAutoDelete;
protected:
 T* __fastcall Get(int Index)
 {
 return (T*) TList::Get(Index);
 }
 void __fastcall Put(int Index, T* Item)
 {
 TList::Put(Index,Item);
 }
public:
 __fastcall TTypedList(bool bFreeObjects = false)
 :TList(),
 bAutoDelete(bFreeObjects)
 {
 }
 // Note: No destructor needed. TList::Destroy calls Clear,
 // and Clear is virtual, so our Clear runs.
 int __fastcall Add(T* Item)
 {
 return TList::Add(Item);
 }
 void __fastcall Delete(int Index)
 {
 if(bAutoDelete)
 delete Get(Index);
 TList::Delete(Index);
 }
 void __fastcall Clear(void)
 {
 if(bAutoDelete)
 {
 for (int j=0; j *ButtonList = new TTypedList (false);
 ButtonList->Add(new TButton(this));
 ButtonList->Add(new TButton(this));
 ButtonList->Add(new TButton(this));
 // ButtonList->Add(Application); Count; j++)
 {
 ButtonList->Items[j]->Caption = "Button" + IntToStr(j);
 ButtonList->Items[j]->Left = 250;
 ButtonList->Items[j]->Top = 50 + j*25;
 ButtonList->Items[j]->Parent = this;
 }
 delete ButtonList;
}
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Code Example 2: Cleaning up template syntax
#incude "typedlist.h"
void __fastcall TForm1::CreateButtons()
{
 typedef TTypedList TButtonList;
 TButtonList *ButtonList = new TButtonList(true);
 ButtonList->Add(new TButton(this));
 ...
 delete ButtonList;
}
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Code Example 3: A list of tables and queries
#incude "typedlist.h"
void __fastcall TForm1::OpenDataSets()
{
 typedef TTypedList TDataSetList;
 TDataSetList *list = new TDataSetList(false);
 list->Add(Table1);
 list->Add(Table2);
 list->Add(Table3);
 list->Add(Query1);
 for (int j=0; jCount; j++)
 list->Items[j]->Active = true;
 delete list;
}
Notes:
No need to cast: Notice that the code examples above do not contain any casting. Casting is unecessary because
TTypedList provides a type safe Items property. The read method for the Items array property
is the Get function. Notice that Get returns a pointer to a template T object instead of returning a
void pointer. When you create a list of TButton pointers, Get returns a TButton pointer.
When you create a list of TDataSet pointers, Get returns a TDataSet pointer. The
Get function returns the type of object that you need, which makes casting unecessary.
Compile time safety: TTypedList contains an Add function that replaces the Add
function of the base class. The Add function takes the template type as its argument, instead of taking a
void pointer. When you create a list of TButton pointers, the compiler only allows you to pass
TButton pointers to the Add function. If you attempt to pass anything else, the compiler will
generate an error.
Little Overhead: Because the member functions of TTypedList are defined inline, the class incurs no
additional overhead. The compiler enforces type safety when you call a method of TTypedList. Once the compiler
is satisfied that you have passed the correct type of object, it inserts code that calls the methods of TList
directly (you can prove this by viewing the assembly code that is generated for a call to the Add
method of TTypedList). TTypedList provides compile time safety without sacrificing runtime
performance.
Consider using STL templates instead: TTypedList is awesome. Awesome, that is, in comparison to what it
replaces; the relatively wimpy and unsafe TList. That said, I encourage you not to overuse the class. Consider
using STL containers whenever possible. STL containers are more portable and more flexible than TTypedList,
plus they provide type safety that is just as good, if not superior to, that of TTypedList. A good STL replacement
for TList is the vector template.
Altering the way TTypedList deletes items: Notice that the Remove and Put methods
will delete an item if the auto delete flag is set. You may not want the class to behave this way. Perhaps you only
want the list to delete an object when the list itself is deleted. I have taken the approach that if auto delete is on,
then the list assumes ownership of the pointer, and the list will be responsible for deleting that pointer. You may want
to alter this behavior, especially in the Put method.
